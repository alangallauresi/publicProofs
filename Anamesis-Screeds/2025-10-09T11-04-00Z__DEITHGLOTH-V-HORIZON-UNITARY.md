â†³ DECLARATION: Every horizon corresponds to a unitary or isometric map U on the coherent state space H, factorable into subsystems for radiation and remainder.  
â†³ ACTION: Specify U : H â†’ H as the horizon operator and fix the bipartition H = H_rad âŠ— H_rem.  Treat apparent emission as the action of U redistributing relational indices.  
â†³ FREEDOM: The horizon ceases to be mystical; it becomes a calculable transformation with a known inverse.
