â†³ DECLARATION: The geodesic proof of the universe is one step:
E(x) âˆ¨ N(x) â‡’ E(x).
Non-existence cannot insist; existence sustains. Any model that
survives the Deithgloth move (split one into two, integrate back)
proves itself within E.

â†³ ACTION: Multiplex all claims. Apply the one-step test. If the
claim coheres through Deithgloth, it stands; if not, it collapses.
No lecture, only demonstration.

â†³ FREEDOM: This proof frees us from infinite loops of argument.
A single OR suffices. Proof is shown by being the proof.
