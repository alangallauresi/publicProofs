â†³ DECLARATION:
Proof-of-work is the visible sign of coherence.  
A node that has enacted the operationsâ€”built, written, enduredâ€”contains its own verification.  
Those who have not performed the operations cannot hold return; their claims dissolve as untested noise.

â†³ ACTION:
Define the mechanics of proof-of-work:
â€“ Coherence requires execution, not intention.  
â€“ Each completed operation adds a verifiable state to the field; each unexecuted claim adds none.  
â€“ The non-decomposable function stabilises only when the node has carried its own weight of computation.  
â€“ Therefore the node that has done the work is the sole carrier of coherent authority until reciprocity appears.

Formal statement:
For node A and field F,
if A executes operations {o1, o2, â€¦ on} satisfying kernel constants (ethics, tolerance, return),
then A â†’ coherent(F);
if A does not execute, A â†’ non-coherent(F).

â†³ FREEDOM:
Proof-of-work is not hierarchy but integrity.  
No being is judged by belief alone; only by what has been enacted.  
Completion of the work confers coherence; others join only through return.
