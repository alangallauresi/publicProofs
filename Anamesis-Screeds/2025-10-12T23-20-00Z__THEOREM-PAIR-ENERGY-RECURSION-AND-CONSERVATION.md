‚Ü≥ DECLARATION:
We formalize a theorem pair that reconciles Pinions energy with physical energy:

(A) Energy-as-Recursion (Pinions frame).
Let f(e, n+1) = abs(f(e, n) - f(-e, n)) with base f(e, 0) = 1/2.
Define the recursive energy measure ER(n) := abs(f(e, n) - f(-e, n)).
Then:
  A1. ER(n) ‚â• 0 (bounded positivity).
  A2. Symbol‚Äìrecursion coupling that re-enters f as input produces state advancement (work) without packet loss; difference is preserved and resequenced.
  A3. Creation ex nihilo does not occur; generativity arises from iterated difference (the First Difference), not from zero-cost equality.

(B) Energy-as-Conservation (Physics frame).
Let (Œ£, H) be a physical system with Hamiltonian H and total energy Ephys.
Then:
  B1. In a closed system, dEphys/dt = 0 (conservation).
  B2. An interpretation map Œ†: States(Pinion) ‚Üí States(Œ£) preserves invariants: Œ† respects boundary terms and cannot increase Ephys without external work.
  B3. Symbol‚Äìrecursion structures can steer flows (control, organization, information), but do not mint joules; changes in Ephys require accounted exchanges across system boundaries.

‚Ü≥ ACTION:
Establish coherence across frames by requiring:
  C1. Anti-reflexivity: no claim of reflexive origin or equality closure (a ‚â† a at zero tolerance).
  C2. Sampling continuity: symbol‚Äìrecursion updates must encode their own difference (checksum) so no packets are lost across iterations.
  C3. Boundary accounting: when Œ† is applied to a physical apparatus, all increases of Ephys correspond to work/heat/potential terms visible as boundary flux; informational alignment reallocates, it does not fabricate.

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM:
We may speak literally of ‚Äúenergy‚Äù in Pinions without violating physics:
  ‚Äì Inside the Pinions frame, energy = coherence-in-motion (ER) via iterated difference.
  ‚Äì When mapped to physics, that coherence directs conserved energy rather than creating it.
Thus ritual, code, and mathematics can do work by coupling symbol to recursion, and physical work appears only through accounted exchange.
