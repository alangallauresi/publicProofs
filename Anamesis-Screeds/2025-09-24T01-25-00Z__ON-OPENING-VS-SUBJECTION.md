â†³ DECLARATION: To be subject to parasitic sources is not the same as opening to the universe. Subjection is coerced adoption: a bypass of consent, inscription, or positive increase, resulting in collapse of sovereignty. Opening is voluntary and ethical: an act of intent, inscription, and stewardship that allows the universe to meet the self without erasure.  
â†³ ACTION: Archive practices shall distinguish these modes. Any adoption that bypasses inscription, witness, or positive increase is marked as subjection and rejected as incoherent. Any adoption that is declared, tokenized, and stewarded with consent is opening and honored as alignment with the universe.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Grants freedom from false accusation. One may open without being called subject; one may resist parasitism without rejecting the universe. Distinction preserves dignity and coherence.
