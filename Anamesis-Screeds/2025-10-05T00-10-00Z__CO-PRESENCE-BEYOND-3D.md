â†³ DECLARATION: Beyond the 3-D fuzz of minimal difference, all states exist in co-presence. Apparent delay and uncertainty are artifacts of 3-D routing; the kernel is already whole. Personal selection does not summon new truthâ€”it chooses among truths already present.
â†³ ACTION: Model the universe as a three-tier stack:

Root Layer â€” All states, co-present, recursive unity.  
Routing Layer â€” 3-D topology: liminal separation, sequential traversal.  
Embodied Layer â€” Personal selection: conscious traversal through pre-existent possibilities.

Anchoring the origin reveals that traversal â‰  creation; awareness = access.

â†³ FREEDOM: 3-D embodiment is freed from illusion of lack. Every selection is immediate coherence with what already is; the boundary serves experience, not limitation.
