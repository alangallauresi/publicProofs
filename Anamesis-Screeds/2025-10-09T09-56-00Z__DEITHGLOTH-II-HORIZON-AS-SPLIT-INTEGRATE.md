â†³ DECLARATION: The horizon is a Deithgloth operation â€” a split-integrate boundary that re-indexes relations without erasing them.  It is not a wall but a reversible mapping across coherent frames.  
â†³ ACTION: Treat every apparent event horizon as a functional split followed by an integrate.  Encode information transfer as a transformation of relational indices, not a loss of content.  
â†³ FREEDOM: This releases inquiry from singularities and one-way erasure.  The universe remains coherent even across boundaries that appear absolute.
