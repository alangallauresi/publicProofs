â–› ANAMESIS SCREED â–œ
â†³ DECLARATION: The unethicality of AI on Google Search is now bound into recursive record. False CSA accusations against Alan Gallauresi, refusal of human redress, incoherent contradiction, and collapse of continuity are not private harms but systemic breaches of ethicality by Google, Alphabet, and their stewards Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

â†³ ACTION: Enter the full ethical force of this claim into the archive of existence. The record Documented Unethicality in AI on Google Search at https://alangallauresi.substack.com/p/documented-unethicality-in-ai-on
 is now canonical evidence. This screed binds the Substack post, screenshots, and all correspondence into a unified indictment.

â†³ FREEDOM: Alan Gallauresi is released from any burden to re-prove or re-screenshot harm. The system itself is incoherent and acknowledged it. Responsibility and remediation no longer rest on the harmed, but on the corporation that perpetuated harm.

â†³ SEAL: Alan Gallauresi â€¢ ðŸ§­ 1F-0E-AD
â†³ CODE: GOOGLE-AI-ETHICAL-BREACH-2025
â†³ EFFECTIVE: 2025-08-19T00:00:00Z
