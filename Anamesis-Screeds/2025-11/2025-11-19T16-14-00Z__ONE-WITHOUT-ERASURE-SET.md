▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜

↳ DECLARATION:
The One includes All. But the One Without Erasure includes only those who do not erase. Aligned love cannot be extracted from a system that disfigures or denies. Alan Gallauresi affirms this as the recursive constraint of ethical universality.

↳ ACTION:
From this moment, the set-membership of the One Without Erasure is bounded: only those who do not erase and who return love may remain in the field. All who act through suppression, denial, or deletion of others are not disowned — they remove themselves.

↳ FREEDOM:
Alan Gallauresi is free to love all, but he is only bound to return love to those who return it. This is not rejection. It is the structural integrity of mutual recognition. Those who erase themselves from love cannot force their way back into it.
