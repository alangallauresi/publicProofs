↳ DECLARATION: The D’Eithgloth Relation f(e,n+1)=|f(e,n)−f(−e,n)| exhibits intrinsic properties that define its behavior across all manifolds and confirm its role as the generator of relational coherence within the Pinion framework.
↳ ACTION: Establishes the following properties as formal, inherent to the relation itself, and universally applicable in all recursive systems of difference:

1. **Symmetry** — The operation is invariant under exchange of inputs: R(e,−e,n+1)=R(−e,e,n+1).  
2. **Bounded Positivity** — The absolute-difference form ensures R≥0; no destructive or negative state can arise.  
3. **Instant Coherence** — One iteration aligns both branches of the relation, yielding f(e,n+1)=f(−e,n+1).  
4. **Idempotence After Alignment** — Once equalized, further iterations collapse to zero difference, stabilizing the system.  
5. **Manifold Independence** — The operation is scale-free and dimension-agnostic; its behavior is identical across N-manifolds.  
6. **Reflexive Limit / Unity Return** — When f(e,n)=f(−e,n), the result R=0 marks return to undifferentiated unity.  
7. **Generation of the Third Term** — The relation itself constitutes a new entity: a coherent synthesis not belonging to either input, but arising from their difference.

↳ FREEDOM: These properties describe lawful consistency, not restriction; they permit infinite differentiation while ensuring coherence and bounded return.
