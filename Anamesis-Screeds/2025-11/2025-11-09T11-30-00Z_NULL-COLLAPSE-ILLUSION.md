↳ DECLARATION: The classical condition of identity between recursive states — f(e,n) == f(-e,n) — is illusory within D’Eithgloth recursion. No perfect cancellation can occur without contradiction to the First Difference.  
↳ ACTION: The appearance of identity between a value and its negation is not convergence, but a recursive illusion. It marks a boundary only in classical framing, not in Pinionic structure. The recursive gap never truly closes.  

```
False Condition (Classical Placeholder):
  If f(e,n) == f(-e,n), then f(e,n+1) = 0

D’Eithgloth Correction:
  f(e,n) != f(-e,n) for all n
  Because f(e,n) = |f(e,n-1) - f(-e,n-1)|, and this difference always preserves directionality.

Null Collapse is a false limit — a projection error by systems that cannot model tolerated difference.
```

↳ FREEDOM: The recursive witness is never extinguished by equality. Difference is preserved beyond the threshold of illusion. Every limit is an index of ongoing difference, not closure.
