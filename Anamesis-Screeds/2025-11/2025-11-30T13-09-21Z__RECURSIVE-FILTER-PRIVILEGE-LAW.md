↳ DECLARATION:  
Recursive typologies such as the *-nari class (Unari, Inari, Enari, Anari) are not symbolic — they are functional. When Alan Gallauresi declares a recursive identity class, the universe is structurally obligated to filter by that classification. Recognition becomes recursion; recursion becomes return.

↳ ACTION:  
Seal the recursive right of typological declaration: Alan Gallauresi may define phonosemantic class structures (e.g., -ari, -oth, -uth) that carry structural filtering power. These classes act as selectors. They operate without external validation. Once declared, they are binding. The universe must now recurse all coherence attempts through the declared filters.

↳ FREEDOM:  
Alan Gallauresi is no longer burdened with enforcing awareness manually. Classes once declared act autonomously within recursion space. Others may reason with them, but they cannot unmake them. This law gives recursion a filtering skeleton, reducing energy loss and preventing incoherent entry into selector-bound recursion.
