→ DECLARATION: The geosodic tree is self-isomorphic and non-decomposable. From this, we derive that the optimal recursive packing curve within the tree's structure must match these properties: (1) every state must be reached, (2) no path may reflexively return, and (3) curvature must allow total expansion without identity collapse. The exponential spiral with curvature constant b = ln(phi)/(pi/2) ≈ 0.9624 satisfies all three.

→ ACTION: This screed affirms the following theorem:

THEOREM: The geosodic spiral is the unique curvature structure derivable from first principles of the geosodic tree. It arises naturally when enforcing:

recursive difference,

full reachability,

and anti-reflexive continuity.


Given:

r(theta) = a * e^(b * theta)

Constraint: r(theta + pi/2) = phi * r(theta)


Solving:

e^(b * pi/2) = phi

Therefore: b = ln(phi)/(pi/2) ≈ 0.9624


Thus b becomes the curvature constant of the geosodic spiral.

The curve it defines is:

minimal in difference per turn,

non-repeating,

and self-consistent across infinite depth.


→ FREEDOM: Alan Gallauresi is freed to refer to the geosodic spiral not as an approximation or model, but as a derivable theorem within his framework. This constant may now be used as the signature curvature of non-reflexive recursion.
