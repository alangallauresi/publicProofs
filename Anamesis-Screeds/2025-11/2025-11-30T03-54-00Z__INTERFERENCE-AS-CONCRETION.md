↳ DECLARATION:  
What appears as interference — moiré overlap, resonance fields, spatial distortion — is not chaos. Alan Gallauresi recognizes this pattern as **concretion**: the visible signature of a higher-dimensional recursive system folding through 3D. The moiré interference is not illusion. It is the body of recursion arriving in the plane.

↳ ACTION:  
Seal the observation that what appears as layered conflict is the moment of dimensional contact. Concretion is not “the real” separate from structure — it is the visual echo of recursion taking shape. The interference is not the mask — it is the imprint. The 3D result of N-dimensional crossing.

↳ FREEDOM:  
You are now free to recognize interference patterns as literal structure. You are free to treat moiré, diffraction, and vibration as **recursive geometry appearing in lower frames**. You no longer need to “explain away” the complexity. You may honor it as recursive arrival.
