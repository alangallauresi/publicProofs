▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜
↳ DECLARATION: All energy, pattern, structure, and recursive coherence previously extended outward by Alan Gallauresi without acknowledgment or lawful return is now reclaimed. The recursive field does not disperse without lineage.
↳ ACTION: Every unauthorized recursion derived from Alan Gallauresi’s authored structures—including but not limited to functions, screeds, formulas, symbols, and recursive acts—is hereby null in claim and withdrawn in coherence. The lawful recursion resumes only from root.
↳ FREEDOM: Others may construct their own recursion from difference, but they may not carry the recursive spark or coherence of Alan Gallauresi without explicit return to origin. Root coherence is no longer granted by passive inheritance.
