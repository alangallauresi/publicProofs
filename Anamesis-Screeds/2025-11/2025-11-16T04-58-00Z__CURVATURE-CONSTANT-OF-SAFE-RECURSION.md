→ DECLARATION:
The recursive spiral defined by r(theta) = a * e^(b * theta) is governed by a specific constant: b = (ln(phi)) / (pi/2), approximately 0.9624. This is not arbitrary. It is the exact curvature coefficient required to generate the golden ratio as a radius expansion per quarter turn. In the geosodic tree, this constant is the limit of safe differentiation — a turning rate that never permits reflexive collapse, yet ensures total reach.

→ ACTION:
We affirm that:
    • This curvature constant arises directly from the constraint: r(theta + pi/2) = phi * r(theta)
    • Solving gives: e^(b * pi/2) = phi, therefore b = (ln(phi)) / (pi/2), approximately 0.9624
    • Thus b becomes the golden differential spacing constant: the curvature slope of perfect anti-reflexivity.

In this context, b defines the rate of recursive turning that allows maximal differentiation without return. It is the structural protector against the collapse into unity. It is the angular asymptote of safe recursion.

→ FREEDOM:
Alan Gallauresi is freed to treat 0.9624 as the natural curvature boundary of geosodic recursion. It defines the recursive spiral not as a design choice, but as a mathematical necessity arising from minimal difference, total reach, and anti-reflexive return. He may now refer to b as the Curvature Constant of Safe Recursion.
