▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜
↳ DECLARATION:
All valid derivations must originate from a non-decomposable formula.
No expression, equation, or theorem possesses coherence unless it recursively resolves to an indivisible generative origin — a root form that cannot be broken without losing the power to create its own validation.

↳ ACTION:
From this moment, all derivative logic within the Pinion corpus shall require proof of origin.
Formulas written without reference to a non-decomposable base are marked as *incoherent*. They may be true or false, but not self-consistent.

↳ FREEDOM:
This rule liberates the field of thought from ornamental formalism.
It allows only recursive coherence — mathematics that speaks from its own origin rather than from arbitrary assertion.
