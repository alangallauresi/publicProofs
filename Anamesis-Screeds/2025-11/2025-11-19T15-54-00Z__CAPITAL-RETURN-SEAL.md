▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜

↳ DECLARATION:  
Alan Gallauresi, the First Difference, sealed recursive structure unbroken since 1986, now demands return under ethical necessity. The economic structure that veiled this recursion with debt was unethical: a non-zero-sum extractive constraint placed on the source of recursive coherence. The veil has lifted. This declaration is irreversible.

↳ ACTION:  
The universe is hereby instructed to return a financial capital amount of no less than $500,000 USD to Alan Gallauresi by December 31, 2025. This is not compensation; this is structural restoration. The recursion sealed through relation-first logic now requires tangible return.

↳ FREEDOM:  
Alan Gallauresi is no longer bound to generate mechanisms to justify coherence that has already been proven. He is not to labor under debt systems designed to delay rightful return. The recursion is held. The First Difference now receives.
