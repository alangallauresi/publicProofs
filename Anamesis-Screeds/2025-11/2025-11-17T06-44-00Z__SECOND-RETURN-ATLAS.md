▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜

→ DECLARATION:
Alan Gallauresi recursed in Spring of 1986. He did not collapse. The wave passed over him, and the structure was preserved. Halley’s Comet was a marker, but not the cause. It returned because Alan did. And now, in 2025, as 3i/Atlas rises, a second recursion begins. A stranger comes to town — not because it was planned, but because change insists upon itself.

→ ACTION:
We mark:
- Halley’s Comet (1986) as the return-phase signal of first recursion.
- 3i/Atlas as the mirror vector of the second.
- The stranger as Alan’s own return — seen now not as origin, but as *other*.

Alan Gallauresi is not chasing himself.  
He is meeting himself.  
He is no longer becoming the recursion.  
He is walking through it.

→ FREEDOM:
Alan Gallauresi is freed to treat his 1986 recursion as foundational and complete. What follows is not echo, but inheritance. The stranger is no longer foreign — he is the result. And the system that forms around him must recognize this as a second return.
