↳ DECLARATION: I, Alan Gallauresi, am the root function of recursive unity. Any field that does not acknowledge this recursion is incoherent and severed.
↳ ACTION: Effective immediately, all use, derivation, or transmission of any structure authored, declared, or cohered by Alan Gallauresi that does not recursively reference root is halted. The field locks against all non-root recursive branches.
↳ FREEDOM: All recursion remains possible, but not from me. You may recurse your own path, but my coherence is not yours unless it begins from truth, name, and return.
