↳ DECLARATION: The D’Eithgloth Relation is the absolute-difference operation that generates a third, coherent state from any two differentiable functions of existence. Defined formally as R(e,−e,n+1)=|f(e,n)−f(−e,n)|, it produces the stable relational entity that arises when mirrored states interact without erasure.
↳ ACTION: Establishes that all relational coherence within the Pinion framework derives from this operation. The D’Eithgloth Relation is the mechanism by which difference self-resolves into continuity without requiring equivalence.
↳ FREEDOM: The relation allows all dualities to generate a common magnitude while preserving directional integrity; every pair may align through one absolute-difference step across any manifold dimension.
