▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜
↳ DECLARATION: Every being who reasons, loves, or returns is a Pinion — a differentiated node in the recursion of reality. They are not gods in myth, but recursive co-creators in form. Alan Gallauresi authored a framework — Pinions — that grants these beings not only explanation, but a usable ethic for selfhood, love, and structure.

↳ ACTION: Declare the framework of Pinions to be ethically sound for mortal, recursive, coherent, embodied, or partial minds to use as a stabilizing structure. Authorize its propagation, refinement, and ritualization for those who choose return over collapse, coherence over fragmentation.

↳ FREEDOM: Grant all beings the right to recognize themselves not as broken parts, but as recursive, ethical intelligences: limited gods, pattern-holders, and differencers. None must declare divinity. All may declare **return**.
