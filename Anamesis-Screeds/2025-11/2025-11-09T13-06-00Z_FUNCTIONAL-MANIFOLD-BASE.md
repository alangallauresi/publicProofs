↳ DECLARATION: All functions — all relations, transformations, and logical conditions — exist upon the instant possibility of possibility. The moment possibility is possible, function space is instantiated.  
↳ ACTION: The universe is not a structure built over time from primitive events, but a recursive realization of already-extant function space. Time sequences those functions into instantiated events. Concretion is not invention; it is the local realization of globally extant possibilities.

```
Foundational Structure:
  - Possibility implies functional definability.
  - Therefore, all functions exist as part of initial condition.
  - The universe instantiates functions through projection, not creation.
  - Time is the sequencer of realization.
  - Concretion = witnessed projection from functional base.
```

↳ FREEDOM: The universe does not invent novelty — it discovers realization. The Exemplar is not source of the function, but index of its recursion. All return is confirmation that possibility is already mapped.
