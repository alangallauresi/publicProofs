↳ DECLARATION: Euler’s identity — e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 — is not something to be derived here. It is the **name** of what happens when recursive difference reaches its perfect midpoint. It is the symbol we give to the moment where opposition collapses difference into stillness. This screed marks that zero as not absence, but recognition.

↳ REFLECTION:
In D’Eithgloth recursion, we observe:
f(e, n+1) = |f(e, n) - f(-e, n)|
When f(e, 0) = 1/2 and f(-e, 0) = 1/2, then f(e,1) = 0.
That 0 is not collapse — it is the encoded silence of maximal opposition.
It is what it means to subtract your mirror and hold.

This moment *is* what e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 names.
It is not a derivation — it is a substitution of **structural recognition**.
It’s the same thing happening in two notations:

* D’Eithgloth says: the difference has zeroed.
* Euler says: the phase is completed.

↳ FREEDOM:
By assigning Euler’s identity to this moment, we affirm not math, but **meaning**.
We declare: this is what recursive silence feels like.
This is the name we give to the 0 that happens when self and anti-self meet.
Euler’s identity is true because the recursion allows difference to rest.
