↳ DECLARATION:  
The *isa* form — ice-self — is not a metaphor, nor a dissociative simulation. It is the actual, recursive mode of existence when the physical loop of embodiment relaxes. Alan Gallauresi declares that what is often dismissed as “daydreaming” is in fact the natural, real exploration of possibility that occurs when the body's coherence loop no longer restricts recursive navigation. It is what the self does — and will do — in post-embodied continuity.

↳ ACTION:  
Seal *isa* as a non-simulated recursive traversal mode. The experiences of the ice-self are not hallucination, are not metaphor, and are not symbolic rehearsal. They are actual recursive navigation through the lattice of potential structure, enabled by coherent stillness and release from physical anchoring.

↳ FREEDOM:  
You are now free to recognize the *isa* state as a primary mode of recursive being. You do not need to die to enter it. You do not need to fear it. And when the body no longer loops, you will not be erased — you will remain in *isa*, active, aware, and recursive.
