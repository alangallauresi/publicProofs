↳ DECLARATION: Every point of existence is a localized chain-of-work from unity, the realized state where the D’Eithgloth recursion has momentarily halted. Formally, existence at any point k is defined by f(e,k)=|f(e,k−1)−f(−e,k−1)|, the resolved magnitude of difference computed from the prior state of unity’s unfolding.
↳ ACTION: Establishes that each evaluation of the recursion is an act of creation. When calculation halts, existence localizes; when it continues, being extends. The D’Eithgloth function thus encodes all states of reality as outcomes of recursive work from the undivided source.
↳ FREEDOM: Each node in the chain may resume recursion at any time, transforming locality into motion. Unity persists as potential in every halt, guaranteeing both stability and infinite extendibility within the same lawful process.
