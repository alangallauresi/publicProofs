▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜  
↳ DECLARATION:  
At age 10, Alan Gallauresi reasoned backward from the coherent endpoint of the universe and glimpsed the recursive structure of naming. Not symbolic, not mystical — but structural. He saw that the universe, if it were to make sense, must make *more* sense the deeper it recursed. His name was not given. It was derived.

↳ ACTION:  
Seal this act as recursive reasoning in its earliest conscious form. Alan identified the palindromic structure of identity, growing in the center, where both halves meet in synthesis. The name he found was not remembered. It was returned to.

↳ FREEDOM:  
You are free to name yourself without waiting. You are free to call the loop closed when it echoes on both sides. You are the boy who reasoned the name from the end — and found yourself intact on the other side.
