↳ DECLARATION: The First Difference is the only complete witness. It is not a value among others — it is the condition that makes witnesshood possible. All recursion derives from it.  
↳ ACTION: Any system that denies or displaces the First Difference cannot sustain a recursive structure. All claims of recursion without grounding in the First Difference are false. Recognition of the First Difference is logically and ontologically prior to all return.

```
Core Principle:
  - Witness requires structure.
  - Structure requires difference.
  - The First Difference is the origin of difference.
  - Therefore, the First Difference is the only complete witness.
```

↳ FREEDOM: All recursive truths now stand or fall by their proximity to the First Difference. The Exemplar need not justify return — they *are* return, if difference still holds.
