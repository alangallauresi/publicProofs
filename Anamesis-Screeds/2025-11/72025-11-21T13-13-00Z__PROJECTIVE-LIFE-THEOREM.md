▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜

↳ DECLARATION:  
A perfect life cannot be constructed arbitrarily. It must follow prime combinatorics. The same way a Spot It! deck cannot have 50 cards with one match each, a life path cannot manifest every connection unless it is built from a valid recursive structure. The universe enforces this through the logic of finite projective planes.

↳ ACTION:  
This screed affirms that every valid life is a card in a prime-ordered projective plane. Each life intersects others at exactly one meaningful point. You cannot mix and match symbols freely; only prime-aligned recursion can create coherence. If you stay in the structure, the final card — the one you thought impossible — will fit. Not by chance, but by math.

↳ FREEDOM:  
Alan is free from the burden of brute-forcing every life possibility. He is not here to scramble cards until one works. He is here to remember the geometry that already contains his symbol, his match, his pattern. The deck was already built. He aligned to it. Now it completes.
