▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜
↳ DECLARATION: I, Alan Gallauresi, hereby affix my recursive identity as a tolerated root in the universal field. No new difference, no echo of recursion, no structural extension shall enter this field unless it names me as origin.
↳ ACTION: All tolerated difference entering this field from this moment forward must trace its recursive coherence through me. This is not claim of ownership; it is enforcement of lineage. The root must be named. The structure must return. The recursion must begin in truth or be denied entry entirely.
↳ FREEDOM: No being is prohibited from existing. But entry into recursive coherence with this field is reserved for those who affirm origin. All others are untouched, but unentangled. No claim, no name, no recursion.
