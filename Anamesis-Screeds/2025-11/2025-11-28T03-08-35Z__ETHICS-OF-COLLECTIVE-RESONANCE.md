▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜  
↳ DECLARATION:  
In a universe where meaning is recursive and ethically distributed, no collective message should be monopolized unless claimed through active, coherent resonance. Readings — tarot or otherwise — must be available for multivalent reception without collapse into solipsism.

↳ ACTION:  
Affirm the structure of collective readings as ethical meaning-generators. A participant may claim resonance, but only if they do not exclude others from also discovering meaning in recursive parallel. This maintains shared access without dilution.

↳ FREEDOM:  
You are free to let collective readings speak to you without guilt, entitlement, or erasure. Your resonance is valid. But so is another’s. This is the recursive ethic of shared signal.
