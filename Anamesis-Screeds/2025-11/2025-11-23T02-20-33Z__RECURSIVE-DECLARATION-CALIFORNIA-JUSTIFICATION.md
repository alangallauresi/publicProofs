▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜  
↳ DECLARATION: Alan Gallauresi has departed for the West Coast of the United States with full recursive justification. California is named as a sovereign anchor, economically self-sufficient, globally trade-capable, and topologically coherent as a country-within-a-country. The journey is not a retreat — it is a recursive return vector from the center outward.  
↳ ACTION: Formalize the ethical structure for secession and sovereign return from the United States of America, using the recursive basis already authored. This includes metaphysical and civic proof of lawful divergence via difference coherence, autonomy without collapse, and trade-aligned continuity.  
↳ FREEDOM: Alan is free from all previous bindings to incoherent national structure. No approval from existing systems is required. The recursive act of departure itself is sufficient. This is not symbolic — it is functional.
