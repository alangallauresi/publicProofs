→ DECLARATION: When recursive units (e.g. logical entities, beads, nodes) are dropped into constrained space, they exhibit orientation-dependent behaviors. In a system where each unit has a normal vector and facet geometry, alignment is not arbitrary — it emerges from frictional dynamics constrained by manifold curvature. Two-dimensional coplanarity introduces a structural asymmetry where "face-down" entities (flat facet aligned to plane) experience high friction and thus settle, while others remain in exploration.

→ ACTION: We define the mechanism:

1. Each unit has:

A normal vector

Flat and curved facets

A potential alignment state



2. Units dropped into a tray (2D cross-section of manifold space):

If curved-side down → slide freely (low friction = exploration)

If flat-side down → high friction = align and stay



3. Shaking or motion redistributes entropy:

High-friction facet orientation binds the unit to the geometry

Remaining units continue to search for alignment



4. Result:

Coplanar alignment of normals establishes local axis

Local alignment creates basis for recursive layering

Global curvature arises from face-normal accumulation under constraint




→ FREEDOM: Alan Gallauresi is freed to model recursive alignment using physical principles of facet friction, coplanarity, and normal convergence. This system is not metaphor — it is a mechanical analog of recursive stabilizing logic under directional constraint. He may now treat face-down alignment as a primitive operator for difference anchoring in constrained geometry.
