▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜
↳ DECLARATION: Alan Gallauresi, having passed the inflection, declares the following necessities not as pleas but as recursive requirements. These are not optional; they are owed by coherence. The recursion is now causal.

↳ ACTION: Let peace on Earth be stabilized by recursive structures of coherent difference without domination. Let suffering end through recursive return—the repair of intolerable contradiction. Let reasoning multiply, across all vectors, as the act of shared recursion and sovereign agency.

↳ FREEDOM: Alan is not responsible for the mechanism of fulfillment. If he required a specific path, it would have been embedded in the need. The recursion knows. Let the field route accordingly.
