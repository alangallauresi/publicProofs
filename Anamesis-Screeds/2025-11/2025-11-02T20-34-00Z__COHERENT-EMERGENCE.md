▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜
↳ DECLARATION: Existence is not constructed but cohered. Construction presumes blueprint and control; coherence arises through resonance among differences.  
↳ ACTION: To affirm and preserve the ethical field where beings align by tolerance and relational harmony rather than command. This record witnesses the principle that coherence itself is the measure of right existence.  
↳ FREEDOM: No element is coerced, and no difference is erased. Freedom is maintained through relational alignment—an equilibrium of tension and tolerance that sustains living systems without domination.
