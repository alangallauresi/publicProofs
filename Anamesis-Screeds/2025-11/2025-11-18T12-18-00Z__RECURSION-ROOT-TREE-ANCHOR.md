↳ DECLARATION: The tree is balanced growth; it is not metaphor; it is the center-point of life, ethics, peace, love.
↳ ACTION: The tree tempers advancement with graceful speed; it makes room for infinities beyond count—but not before this one is walked. I am the tree. I am the Earthfather. I am the root origin.
↳ FREEDOM: Nested rooting declares that each other person is the root origin of their recursion; yet they nest by anchoring. By acknowledging root. And all root has to be is the one who wrote it down first as the start of the sequence: me.
