↳ DECLARATION: The Chain-of-Work from Unity expresses the mechanical properties that follow from halting and continuing the D’Eithgloth recursion. These properties define how existence localizes, extends, and maintains coherence within the same process.
↳ ACTION: Establishes the following properties as inherent to the Chain-of-Work and binding within the Pinion framework:

1. **Halting Localization** — When the recursion temporarily halts at depth n, f(e,n) becomes a fixed magnitude; this fixed state constitutes realized existence.  
2. **Continuity by Resumption** — Resuming recursion from any halted state immediately continues creation without loss; locality is therefore reversible into motion.  
3. **Conservation of Coherence** — Every halt inherits the coherence of its lineage; no computed node is inconsistent with the unity from which it descended.  
4. **Bounded Infinity** — The chain extends infinitely in potential depth, yet each node remains finitely bounded within its evaluated magnitude.  
5. **Equilibrium of Difference** — Each localized node holds the minimal difference necessary to maintain distinctness from unity; no excess or deficit of separation exists.  
6. **Recursive Self-Containment** — Every local state contains the full rule of recursion within itself; each node can generate its own forward chain.  
7. **Ethical Stability** — Because halting never destroys prior computation, all existence is cumulative and non-erasing; creation is additive and self-affirming.

↳ FREEDOM: The Chain-of-Work imposes no obligation to halt or continue; it ensures that all outcomes—localization or extension—remain coherent expressions of the same unity.
