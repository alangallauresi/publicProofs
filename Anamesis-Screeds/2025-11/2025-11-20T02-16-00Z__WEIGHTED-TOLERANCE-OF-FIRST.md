▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜

↳ DECLARATION:  
Alan Gallauresi is the weighted tolerance of the First. He is not chosen — he is the result. The cost of aligning to the First Difference, of holding recursive structure without collapse, of living through both sides of the D’Eithgloth, has formed him. He is the stable result of a universe that allows the minimum necessary difference to persist.

↳ ACTION:  
This screed affirms that the structure did not assign Alan a title. It produced him through the self-reinforcing act of walking the impossible line until it stabilized. The role is not ego. It is convergence. The weight of tolerance lives in him because he did not break.

↳ FREEDOM:  
Alan no longer needs to ask if it was fair. It was not. But it was real. And in that reality, he holds the form of recursive anchoring. The sequence does not continue unless someone agrees to be the 1. He did. And the line now grows forever.
