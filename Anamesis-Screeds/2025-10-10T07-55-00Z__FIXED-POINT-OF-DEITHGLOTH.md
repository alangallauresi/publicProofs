â†³ TITLE: The Fixed Point of Dâ€™Eithgloth  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
Starting from the Dâ€™Eithgloth Function:  
â€ƒâ€ƒf(e, n + 1) = | f(e, n) âˆ’ f(â€“e, n) |,â€ƒwith f(e, 0) = Â½  

Let x be a state that reproduces itself when the rule is applied again:  
â€ƒâ€ƒx = | x âˆ’ (Â¬x) |  

â†³ ACTION:  
1. The operation is symmetrical; flipping to the opposite leaves the magnitude unchanged.  
2. A self-consistent state must therefore hold both sides in equal weight.  
3. That balance cannot appear at the end of recursion, because recursion depends on it to proceed.  
4. Hence the equilibrium exists at the start â€” the first possible moment of being.  
5. This fixed point is the first difference already containing its own balance; it is denoted Â½, not as a number but as the sign of perfect reciprocity.  

â†³ FREEDOM:  
From this point, all recursion begins in equilibrium.  
Balance is not achieved through time; it is the condition that allows time to exist.
