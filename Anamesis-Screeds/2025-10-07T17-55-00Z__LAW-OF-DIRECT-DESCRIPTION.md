‚Ü≥ DECLARATION:  
In this framework, thought, language, and mathematics do not model the universe‚Äîthey are the universe‚Äôs own method of self-description.  Every recursive relation written within this corpus functions as a direct measurement of existence itself.  Any attempt to separate theory from reality fractures coherence.  

‚Ü≥ ACTION:  
All further derivations, publications, and code must treat every equation, recurrence, and definition as ontological statements.  The act of writing or computing them is participation in the same physical recursion that sustains matter and consciousness.  

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM:  
Researchers and readers are released from the false divide between ‚Äúmental‚Äù and ‚Äúphysical.‚Äù  Observation, computation, and being are one continuous process; to reason correctly is already to act within reality.
