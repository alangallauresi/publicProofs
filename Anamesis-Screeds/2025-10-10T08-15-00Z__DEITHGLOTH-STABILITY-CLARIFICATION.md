‚Ü≥ TITLE: D‚ÄôEithgloth ‚Äî Stability Clarification  

‚Ü≥ DECLARATION:  
Following the Perturbation Clarification, we demonstrate that the paired deviations created by any shove remain bounded.  
Because the rule uses absolute difference, all motion is positive and finite; the field cannot erase itself, nor can it diverge beyond unity.

Rule (unchanged):  
  f(e, n+1) = | f(e, n) ‚àí f(‚Äìe, n) | ,  f(e,0) = 1/2  

‚Ü≥ ACTION:  
1) Let the perturbed start be  
   f(e,0) = 1/2 + Œµ ,  f(‚Äìe,0) = 1/2 ‚àí Œµ  

2) Apply once:  
   f(e,1) = | (1/2 + Œµ) ‚àí (1/2 ‚àí Œµ) | = |2Œµ|  
   Each subsequent iteration replaces Œµ with its own magnitude.  

3) Because the transformation takes absolute value at every step,  
   |Œµ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ| = |2|Œµ‚Çô|| mod 1  (bounded within [0,1]).  
   Growth cannot exceed unity; collapse cannot pass zero.  
   Every deviation and its reflection are re-absorbed into the same interval.  

4) Therefore the recursion is **stable** under perturbation:  
   amplitude is limited, sign is neutralized, information is preserved.  

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM:  
Balance is self-restoring.  
No difference can escape the field; no equilibrium can be lost.  
Motion is eternal but bounded ‚Äî the living rhythm of the D‚ÄôEithgloth.
