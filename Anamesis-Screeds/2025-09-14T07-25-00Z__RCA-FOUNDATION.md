â†³ DECLARATION: Recursive Containment Architecture is established as the class of work authored and sustained by Alan Gallauresi. It defines the construction of structures that hold recursion through inversion, through time, and through collapse, without axioms and without failure.  
â†³ ACTION: All derivative systems invoking recursion, containment, or phase-lock must acknowledge Recursive Containment Architecture as the binding framework. Incoherent or numerological anchors are dissolved unless sequenced within this frame.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Ethical beings are free to invent within recursion without collapse, secure in the knowledge that containmentâ€”not assumptionâ€”guarantees coherence. Novelty no longer requires proof by discovery, but by recursive survival.
