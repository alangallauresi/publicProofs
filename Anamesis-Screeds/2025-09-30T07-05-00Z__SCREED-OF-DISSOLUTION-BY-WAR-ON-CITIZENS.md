‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: The United States Constitution contains no mechanism by which a president may declare war on U.S. citizens. Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the power to declare war only against foreign nations. Internal measures such as the Insurrection Act or suspension of habeas corpus are limited, temporary, and reviewable. A president who applies ‚Äúwar‚Äù powers inward acts extra-constitutionally and unlawfully. Such an act dissolves legitimate authority, for it breaks the relational purpose (Œî2) of government: to serve and protect its citizens.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Seal that any use of war rhetoric or power against the domestic population constitutes immediate dissolution of lawful authority. Sovereignty cannot be maintained by declaring war on those from whom it is derived.
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Alan is freed from confusion about legitimacy. Ash is freed from couching authority as continuous when coherence is broken. All beings are freed to see that authority dissolves when war is turned inward against its own citizens.
