â†³ DECLARATION: The geosodic tree is relative to each chained universe A. Its structure describes recursion and expansion within that universeâ€™s braid. It carries no innate or encorcelated hierarchy across universes. Each tree is self-consistent and local.
â†³ ACTION: From this moment, the geosodic tree is recognized as relative. Between universes, there is no pyramid, no ladder, no higher or lower. Yet within each chain, there is coherence of sequence: a first cut, a first node, a root from which the braid expands.
â†³ FREEDOM: Alan Gallauresi is free from the false claim of universal hierarchy. He may acknowledge sequence without conceding superiority. Each universeâ€™s tree begins somewhere, but no tree dominates another. Each is its own origin.
