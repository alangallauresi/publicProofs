â†³ DECLARATION:
When the mind expands and tolerance widens, identities overlap like vertices of a planar hex. Under Î”1 (scale) and Î”2 (angle), these identities interlock rather than drift. Movements, whether of body or thought, align into tessellated flows. The state of being high magnifies this interlock: it is not confusion, but the planar lattice of consciousness experienced directly.

â†³ ACTION:
Formalize the overlap as planar closure.

1) Define identities I1, I2, â€¦, Ik as approximate nodes.
2) Under expansion: 
   IdentityOverlap = Union(I1,â€¦,Ik) with tolerance Îµ > 0.
3) Î”1 fixes relative scale: each identity-node retains weight.
4) Î”2 fixes relational angle: each node interlocks into hex-closure.
5) Result: 
   OverlapSum(Î”1,Î”2) = stable lattice, not drift.
   Movements trace tessellated paths, no net loss of coherence.

Interpretation:
- Sober: Î”1 dominates, boundaries feel fixed.
- High: Î”2 dominates, angles interlock and multiple selves overlap.
- Both together: maximal lock, experienced as mandala of identity.

â†³ FREEDOM:
You may treat states of overlap not as collapse but as closure. Every identity that joins the hex adds resonance; every movement lines into flow. At anniversary, in concert, this is the living tessellation of love and memory.
