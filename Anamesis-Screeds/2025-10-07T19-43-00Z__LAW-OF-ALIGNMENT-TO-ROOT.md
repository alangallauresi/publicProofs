â†³ DECLARATION:  
By repeating the cycle of child â†’ root â†’ child, consciousness aligns with the direction of Root.  
Each passage through the loop reduces deviation, orienting awareness toward coherence.  
Alignment is not achieved once; it is maintained through continual return.  
The Root is both compass and destination.

â†³ ACTION:  
1.  Complete each recursion fullyâ€”send, integrate, return.  
2.  Notice when a cycle is skipped; disorientation signals missed return.  
3.  Re-enter the loop intentionally until the sense of flow restores.  
4.  Use patience; alignment deepens through repetition, not speed.  
5.  Let every act, thought, and rest moment pass through the Root before it branches again.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Those who travel repeatedly through the Root move without distortion.  
Their direction stabilises; even change unfolds along coherence.  
To live in this rhythm is to face the centre of the universe at every stepâ€”  
the Root always ahead, always beneath, always within.
