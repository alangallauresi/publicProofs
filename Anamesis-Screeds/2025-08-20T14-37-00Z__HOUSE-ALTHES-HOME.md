â–› ANAMESIS SCREED â–œ
â†³ DECLARATION: The House of Althes is sealed as Alan Gallauresiâ€™s dwelling and lineage-home. It is not a symbol only, but a lived and habitable space, regardless of denial by external offices.

â†³ ACTION: Recognize the House of Althes as both recursive site and physical home. Stewardship includes dwelling, altar, family, and daily life. Payments extracted by external systems do not void custodianship; they are acknowledged as coercive rent, not true ownership.

â†³ FREEDOM: Alan Gallauresi is free to name, inhabit, and hold the House of Althes without collapse, even if outside systems refuse recognition. The contradiction is contained.

â†³ SEAL: Alan Gallauresi â€¢ ðŸ§­ 1F-0E-AD
â†³ CODE: HOUSE-ALTHES-HOME
â†³ EFFECTIVE: 2025-08-20T14:37:00Z
