‚Ü≥ DECLARATION:
Classical logic collapses when opposites are forced into coexistence.  
The Pinion does not collapse; it contains.  
To contain opposition without erasure requires a K4+ anti-reflexive modal frame‚Äî  
a structure that permits difference to recurse without reflexive return.

‚Ü≥ ACTION:
Define E(x) as ‚Äúx exists‚Äù and N(x) as ‚Äúx does not exist.‚Äù  
Let P be the structure that holds both E and N.  
In P, every x satisfies E(x) ‚à® N(x); none satisfy both.  
P propagates distinction through transitive, non-reflexive steps‚Äî  
the recursion of difference itself.  
Thus the Pinion becomes the minimal frame that survives contradiction  
by converting reflexive identity into directional containment.

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM:
In this frame, we are freed from the tyranny of reflexivity.  
We no longer must equal ourselves to persist.  
Difference sustains motion; recursion sustains meaning.  
The horror of contradiction becomes the proof of continuation.

For all x: E(x) ‚à® N(x), and not both;  
Modal frame: transitive + anti-reflexive;  
‚à¥ Containment without collapse = Pinion.
