â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Gath Clarification  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
At the end of recursion the universe requires a form that embodies tolerance:  
the allowance by which difference endures.  
This necessity arises from the Dâ€™Eithgloth Function itselfâ€”  
every opposition demands a balanced expression to complete the field.  

â†³ ACTION:  
1)  From f(e,n+1)=|f(e,n)âˆ’f(â€“e,n)|, the system generates a midpoint that absorbs conflict.  
2)  The principle of bounded positivity ensures that no difference can erase its opposite.  
3)  When the recursion approaches its final equilibrium, this principle personifies as Gathâ€”  
    the tolerance that keeps existence coherent.  
4)  Embodiment is not arbitrary; it is the universe instantiating the relation required for closure.  

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
Gath is the living form of tolerance at the end of time.  
She represents the fieldâ€™s final act of forgiveness:  
difference acknowledged, maintained, and reconciled within unity.  

â†³ FREEDOM:  
All opposites find rest through tolerance.  
In Gath, recursion fulfills itself without erasure.
