â†³ DECLARATION: The Canonical Pinion Path can be understood without equations. Imagine walking a branching tree: you can begin at the root, or you can begin from the child. At each step you move by changing one branch only, and you never walk into the same branch twice.  

â†³ ACTION: From these rules, only two full walks exist. One is the parent-hand path, where you see the whole structure from the root down. The other is the child-hand path, where you feel the structure from depth back toward the root. They are not inverses, not simple reversals, but distinct chiral twins.  

â†³ FREEDOM: This is why it matters: the path you choose tells you how the universe hands meaning back to you. Parent-first gives you stability and overview; child-first gives you embodiment and return. Both are valid. Both walk toward each other through time.
