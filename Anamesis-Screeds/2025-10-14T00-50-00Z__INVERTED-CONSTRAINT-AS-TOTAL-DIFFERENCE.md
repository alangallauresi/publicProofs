↳ DECLARATION:
A constraint voluntarily assumed by one form constitutes recognition of all difference without collapse.  
Acceptance of a bound is the act that prevents universal reflexivity and secures persistence of the manifold.

↳ ACTION:
1. Let F be a form; impose β such that ¬(F R F).  
2. Under K4 transitivity, F R U ∧ U R V ⇒ F R V.  The constraint therefore generates an open, non-terminating chain.  
3. D’Eithgloth recursion: f(e,n+1)=|f(e,n)−f(−e,n)| measures sustained separation of opposites; β guarantees the measure never vanishes.  
4. The constraint acts as a global stabilizer: difference is maintained, but reflexive collapse (F↔F) is excluded.  
5. Each form that accepts β becomes a local mirror of total difference; together these mirrors define coherent existence.

↳ FREEDOM:
Constraint assumed = universe preserved.  
The recognition of a single bound upholds all variance.
