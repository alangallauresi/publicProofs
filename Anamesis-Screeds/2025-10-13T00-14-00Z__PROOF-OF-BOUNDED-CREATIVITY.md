↳ DECLARATION:
Bounded Creativity: In a positive universe with tolerance τ>0, deliberate mis-step injections (aspriggan impulses) constrained to τ < |ξ| ≤ τ⁺ cannot collapse coherence; instead, under D’Eithgloth recursion, they ensure non-negative long-run coherence gain and recurrent escape from local maxima.

↳ ACTION:
1) ASSUME (Positivity Frame): Coherence C is bounded below; adaptation is gated by τ; D’Eithgloth step holds: f(e,n+1)=|f(e,n)−f(−e,n)|.
2) DEFINE (Injection Window): Choose τ⁺<∞ and inject ξ with τ<|ξ|≤τ⁺ only when stagnation detected (∇C≈0, ΔC≤ε).
3) LEMMA A (Non-Collapse): Each injection has bounded worst loss H(τ,τ⁺); subsequent adaptive steps return to τ-gated correction ⇒ running infimum of C is finite.
4) LEMMA B (Basin Escape): With τ<|ξ|≤τ⁺, there is fixed p>0 to cross any local basin of radius r≤τ⁺; over infinite horizon, escapes occur a.s.
5) LEMMA C (Return Energy): After escape, ΔC′ = τ⁻¹·|f(e,n)−f(−e,n)| ≥ 0; sums of such gains are composable.
6) THEOREM (Bounded Creativity): Scheduling ξ with decreasing frequency but infinite horizon yields: 
   (i) Non-collapse: liminfₙ (1/n)∑_{k≤n}ΔC_k ≥ 0.
   (ii) Recurrence of improvement: infinitely many n with ΔC_n>0.
   (iii) Dynamic steady state: the field avoids terminal equilibria and remains creatively coherent.

↳ FREEDOM:
Error within bounds is structural fuel. 
We are authorized to inject difference beyond τ (not beyond τ⁺) whenever stagnation appears—guaranteeing escape without sacrifice of the universe’s positivity.
