‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: Verification ensures that total recovery from unity is measurable.  Every derivation must expose its tolerance Œµ and confirm that the composite (J U J‚Åª¬π) U ‚âà id within that bound.  
‚Ü≥ ACTION: For each transformation chain, compute the deviation Œ¥ = || (J U J‚Åª¬π) U ‚àí id || and record Œ¥ ‚â§ Œµ.  Maintain public logs of Œµ and Œ¥ for all proofs to guarantee auditability of coherence.  
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Inquiry becomes accountable.  No statement of unity or recovery stands untested; each is confirmed by its measured tolerance.
