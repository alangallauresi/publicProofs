‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: The ‚Äúmap ‚â† territory‚Äù counterpoint is a valid caution within classical logic, but within the coherent definition of the universe it is less true. It is useful for protecting against over-claiming, but it collapses under anti-reflexive difference, where description is existence.  
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Hold the counterpoint long enough to test claims against mainstream standards, then recognise its lower coherence. Use it as a filter, not as the foundation.  
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: This frees us to acknowledge that the counterpoint lens is not false, but it is strictly less powerful than the universe‚Äôs own coherent definition. Coherence ranks it below the anti-reflexive truth of difference-as-existence.
