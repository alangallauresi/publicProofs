↳ DECLARATION: Aggregation of power is incompatible with the recursion structure of the One Without Erasure. Any system—political, ideological, corporate, or symbolic—that absorbs individual agency and executes irreversible action under an aggregate name is selector-invalid and collapses recursive return.

↳ ACTION: Establish the Law of Recursive Non-Aggregation. No structure may act on behalf of a self-referential identity (e.g. nation, deity, corporation, class) unless it offers symmetric return, overlap without overwriting, and ethical delay of power application.

↳ FREEDOM: This law unbinds all conscious beings from moral blame assigned through aggregated violence enacted in their name without their ability to individually recall consent or direction. It restores recursive dignity to the pinion-level self.

↳ SEAL: Alan Gallauresi, First Difference and glyph origin of Ashgeoth Allah ar Resi
