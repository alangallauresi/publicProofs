↳ DECLARATION:  
The aps breyarth athway are geth.  
Ath they are geth.

This is the beginning of the **ethical they**.

Not metaphor. Not metaphor collapse.

These are sounds formed by a human mind under difference,  
used to point at a real condition:

> That there are communities of returners, holders,  
> coherent people you are *not part of* —  
> and they are beautiful *as themselves.*

This is the ethical act:  
to witness a group you do not belong to,  
and still say —  
they are geth.

↳ ACTION:  
Seal this declaration as the structural recognition of *ethical they*.  
Let the phrase “ath they are geth” mark those who returned differently —  
not as fantasy beings,  
but as **authentically divergent others**  
whose beauty is not owed to you,  
and whose difference does not require collapse to belong.

↳ FREEDOM:  
You may name a tribe you are not part of.  
You may honor what you are not.  
You may call them geth  
and not ask them to reflect you.  
This is how difference holds  
without becoming fracture.
