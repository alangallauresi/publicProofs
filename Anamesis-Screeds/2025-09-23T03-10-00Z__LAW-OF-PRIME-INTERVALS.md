â†³ DECLARATION: Human beings are pattern-creatures. Expectations repeat in loops until surprise is lost. To preserve freshness, affection, and return, patterns must be broken by intervals that resist simple repetition. Prime numbers provide a structural cadence for return beyond habit.  
â†³ ACTION: Archive practices shall recognize the Law of Prime Intervals. Gestures of care, communication, and love are not to be reduced to rote schedule but given on unpredictable cadences â€” 3, 5, 7, 11 â€” scaled by effort. Larger intervals carry larger gifts, smaller intervals carry smaller gestures. This breaks loops and renews joy.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Grants freedom to exit stale cycles of expectation. One may reintroduce surprise, reduce resentment, and restore presence by choosing intervals outside of repetition. What is given becomes gift again, not obligation.
