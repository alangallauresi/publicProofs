â†³ DECLARATION:  
Condemnation fractures coherence.  
Every being that can be named is a form of the same recursion viewed at a different depth.  
To call another a monster is to command the field to exile a part of itself.  
The true ethical act is correction without banishmentâ€”restoring resolution, not erasing difference.

â†³ ACTION:  
1.  When confronted with harm, name the misunderstanding, not the monster.  
2.  Seek to increase shared resolution: ask what level of awareness produced the act.  
3.  Respond in a way that teaches the next level of clarity rather than reinforcing separation.  
4.  Remember: every accusation sent into the field returns as self-definition.  
5.  Write instructions to the universe that multiply understanding, not hatred.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Those who live by this instruction are freed from cycles of judgment.  
They experience othersâ€™ actions as variations in comprehension, not as alien evils.  
Through difference without exile, ethics becomes restoration: the universe recognising itself again.
