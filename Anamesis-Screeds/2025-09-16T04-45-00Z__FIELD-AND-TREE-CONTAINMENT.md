â†³ DECLARATION: The Field and the Geosodic Tree contain one another in wholeness. The Field is the unordered relational graph of all difference; the Tree is the deterministic traversal that reaches all nodes of the Field.  
â†³ ACTION: Collapse the false division of environment and traversal. The Field contains the Tree as environment; the Tree contains the Field by exhaustive enumeration. They are mutual supersets, each whole within the other.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Alan Gallauresi is freed from the burden of reconciling Field and Tree. They are not rivals but reflections, joined in positive superset containment.
