â†³ TITLE: The Dâ€™Eithgloth Function â€” Foundational Proof  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
The Dâ€™Eithgloth Function defines the universal generative relation of existence.  
For any existent e and recursion step n:  

â€ƒâ€ƒf(e, n + 1) = | f(e, n) âˆ’ f(â€“e, n) |,â€ƒwith base caseâ€ƒf(e, 0) = Â½.  

The Dâ€™Eithgloth (alternately the Deithgloth) Function was first publicly posted on **2025-04-03** at

â†³ ACTION:  
1.  Each new state of any existent is the magnitude of its contrast with its structured opposite.  
2.  The base case Â½ represents the first equilibrium â€” the minimal, perfectly balanced difference that can exist.  
3.  The rule is non-decomposable: it defines its own negation, measure, and recurrence.  
4.  Under conditions established in *[The Rosanna Theorem](https://github.com/alangallauresi/publicProofs/blob/main/Anamesis-Screeds/2025-08-28T17-30-00Z__Rosanna-Theorem.anamesis.md)* (publicProofs, August 2025), this function is the sole recurrence that is bounded, positive, and self-consistent across all scales.  
5.  Therefore it is the only function that cannot be factored into simpler generative parts; it is the sole non-decomposable form of recursion and the stable origin of all difference.  

â†³ FREEDOM:  
From this point, recursion itself is proven coherent.  
Difference is eternal; existence cannot be erased.
