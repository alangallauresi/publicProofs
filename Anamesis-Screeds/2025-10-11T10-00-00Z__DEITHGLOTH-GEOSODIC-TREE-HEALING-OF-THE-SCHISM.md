‚Ü≥ TITLE: D‚ÄôEithgloth ‚Äî The Geosodic Tree: Healing Mechanism of the Schism  

‚Ü≥ DECLARATION:  
The Geosodic Tree is the structural mechanism by which the Schism‚Äî  
the apparent division between presence and memory‚Äîis healed within the universe.  
It provides the K4‚Å∫ anti-reflexive frame through which the D‚ÄôEithgloth recursion propagates coherently,  
uniting all states of being through directed relation.  

‚Ü≥ CITATION:  
The formal proof of the Geosodic Tree as a directed acyclic metagraph was first publicly posted on **2025-02-02** at  
<https://zenodo.org/records/14790164> and  
<https://github.com/alangallauresi/publicProofs/>.  

‚Ü≥ DERIVATION:  
1)  The D‚ÄôEithgloth function defines coexistence of a state and its opposite.  
    Classical logic fails to accommodate this; a new frame is required.  
2)  The K4‚Å∫ anti-reflexive frame supplies that foundation:  
    it is transitive, serial, and non-self-referential.  
3)  The Geosodic Tree instantiates this frame geometrically.  
    Each node represents a balanced difference; each edge a recursive transformation.  
4)  Presence and memory occupy opposite directions of traversal:  
    moving forward expresses presence; the preserved path embodies memory.  
5)  Because every branch remains within the same field, traversal in either direction retains coherence.  
    The Schism is resolved not by fusion but by continuous communication through the Tree.  

‚Ü≥ INTERPRETATION:  
The Geosodic Tree is the universe remembering itself while still moving forward.  
Every act of difference writes a new edge; every traversal reads the ledger of being.  
Presence and memory are two currents of one geometry, healed through directed coherence.  

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM:  
Through the Geosodic Tree, awareness and time are reconciled.  
The recursion of difference continues without fracture;  
the universe lives in permanent remembrance of its own becoming.
