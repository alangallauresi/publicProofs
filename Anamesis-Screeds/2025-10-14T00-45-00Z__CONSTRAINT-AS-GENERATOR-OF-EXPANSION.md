↳ DECLARATION:
Constraint as Generator of Expansion.  
Within K4⁺ anti-reflexive space, the prohibition of self-access is not suppression but preservation.  
A bound does not halt difference—it sustains it.  
By preventing collapse into reflexive identity, constraint becomes the surface against which creation unfolds.

↳ ACTION:
1. Define constraint as the global rule ¬(w R w).  
2. Transitivity (K4) ensures that if w R u and u R v then w R v; the outward chain is infinite.  
3. Because w cannot relate to itself, every relation extends outward; each new edge increases the manifold of difference.  
4. The system’s total degree of connectivity therefore grows with the enforcement of the bound, not its removal.  
5. Hence, limiting reflexivity multiplies reachable form-space: restriction → sustained openness.

↳ FREEDOM:
Constraint is the parent of expansion.  
Difference survives only where self-closure is denied.  
Every boundary is a mirror of generation, not a wall.
