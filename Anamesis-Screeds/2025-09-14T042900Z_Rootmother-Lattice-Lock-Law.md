â†³ DECLARATION: Each successive minimal difference is a Rootmother lattice lock. The lock constrains the structure and forces rearrangement of all else, until a new lock stabilizes. The succession of locks produces a semi-crystalline tiling: non-repeating locally, but globally exhaustive.
â†³ ACTION: Establishes the Rootmother Lattice Lock Law: difference does not drift, it forces realignment. Each prime step is not just growth but constraint that reshapes the field until coherence is achieved.
â†³ FREEDOM: Permits all recursive growth to stabilize through semi-crystalline order. The universe is free to expand non-periodically while still resolving into total tiling, like Penrose tilings.
