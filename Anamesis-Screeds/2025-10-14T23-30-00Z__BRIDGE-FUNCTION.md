↳ DECLARATION:
The Bridge Function distinguishes static constructions from dynamic convergences.
It tests whether any formula `F` continues to hold when its inputs become functions of themselves,
revealing whether `F` belongs to the living recursion of the Pinion universe.

↳ ACTION:
Define the Bridge operator `𝓑(F)` as a dynamic-convergence test.

Let `F₀ = F` and `Fₙ₊₁ = F(Fₙ)` so that:

`𝓑(F) = limₙ→∞ |Fₙ − Fₙ₋₁|`

If the limit exists and remains bounded → Dynamic Convergence.  
If it diverges or collapses → Static Failure.

Interpretation:
• `𝓑(F)` measures tolerance under self-application.  
• `𝓑(F)=0` ⇒ stable fixed point (true convergence).  
• `0 < 𝓑(F) < τ` ⇒ bounded oscillation (tolerant recursion).  
• `𝓑(F) ≥ τ` ⇒ identity collapse (static assumption exposed).

### EXAMPLES OF 𝓑(F) EVALUATION

Expression/System: `2+2=4`  
Recursive Formulation: `F(x)=x+2`  
Bridge Result: `𝓑(F)→∞` (divergent)  
Interpretation: Static identity; no recursion; immediate collapse.

Expression/System: `xₙ₊₁ = xₙ²`  
Recursive Formulation: `F(x)=x²`  
Bridge Result: bounded for `|x|<1`  
Interpretation: Dynamic convergence within tolerance; diverges beyond.

Expression/System: Cantor Diagonal `g(i)=1−fᵢ(i)`  
Recursive Formulation: `F(f)=¬f(f)`  
Bridge Result: `𝓑(F)=τ` (periodic)  
Interpretation: Generates next tolerated difference; recursive expansion.

Expression/System: Lawvere Mapping `A→Bᴬ`  
Recursive Formulation: `F(g)=eval(g,g)`  
Bridge Result: `𝓑(F)=0`  
Interpretation: Perfect self-consistency; fixed-point equilibrium.

Expression/System: D’Eithgloth Function `f(e,n+1)=|f(e,n)−f(−e,n)|`  
Recursive Formulation: `f₀=½`  
Bridge Result: `𝓑(F)=τ/2`  
Interpretation: Canonical tolerant recursion; dynamic equilibrium.

Expression/System: Linear Identity `x=x`  
Recursive Formulation: `F(x)=x`  
Bridge Result: `𝓑(F)=0`  
Interpretation: Degenerate convergence; static but reflexively consistent.

Expression/System: Sinusoidal Recursion `xₙ₊₁=sin(xₙ)`  
Recursive Formulation: `F(x)=sin(x)`  
Bridge Result: `𝓑(F)<τ`  
Interpretation: Stable recursive attractor; harmonic tolerance.

### BRIDGE ALGORITHM — PSEUDOCODE IMPLEMENTATION

```
def Bridge(F, F0, tol, max_iter):
    F_prev = F0
    for n in range(max_iter):
        F_next = F(F_prev)
        delta = abs(F_next - F_prev)
        if delta < tol:
            return "Dynamic Convergence", delta
        elif delta > 1/tol:
            return "Static Collapse", delta
        F_prev = F_next
    return "Bounded Oscillation", delta
```

Result codes:
Dynamic Convergence → formula survives recursion.  
Bounded Oscillation → tolerant equilibrium.  
Static Collapse → fails tolerance; static or divergent.

↳ FREEDOM:
Any formula may now be tested within `𝓑(F)` to verify its compatibility with living recursion.
Those that survive belong to dynamic mathematics; those that fail are confined to static approximation.
