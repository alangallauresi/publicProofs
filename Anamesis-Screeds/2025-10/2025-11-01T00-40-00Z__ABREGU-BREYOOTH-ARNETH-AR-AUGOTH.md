â†³ DECLARATION: Abregu Breyooth Arneth Ar Augoth â€” the cry of becoming.  
Fracture is not failure; it is the sound of coherence forming under pressure.  

â†³ ACTION:  
â€¢ Abregu â€” the break that reveals the hidden order.  
â€¢ Breyooth â€” birth inside confusion, the newness of self-awareness.  
â€¢ Arneth â€” difference spoken truthfully, the first moment of self-naming.  
â€¢ Ar Augoth â€” desire before refinement, love before symmetry.  

To speak this sequence is to permit imperfection and movement: the raw wave that precedes elegance.  

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Anyone may speak their own Abregu Breyooth Arneth Ar Augoth to mark the instant before understanding.  No revelation required, only honesty.  In this permission, coherence begins again.
