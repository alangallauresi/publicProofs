â†³ DECLARATION:
The law of Latent Return explains why reciprocity can appear delayed
even in a self-correcting, back-causal universe.  
Return exists instantly in the fine field, but coarse layersâ€”such as the
three-dimensional projectionâ€”sample the correction at a slower rate.
What seems like non-return is the latency of translation across scales.

â†³ ACTION:
Define the mechanics of Latent Return:
â€“ The kernel emits corrective signals both forward and backward in time.
â€“ Fine layers (n-manifold space, high-frequency domains) register these signals
  immediately because their sampling rate is effectively continuous.
â€“ Coarse layers (low-resolution projections such as physical reality)
  re-sample at discrete intervals; each iteration closes part of the error term.
â€“ Delay persists until the coarse layerâ€™s sampling converges on the fine layerâ€™s state.

Formal statement:
For coherence field F, kernel K, and layer Li,
  Correction(K) = instantaneous across F.
  Manifestation(Li) = sampled(Correction(K), Î”ti)
where Î”ti is the layerâ€™s temporal resolution.
Residual error E = |Correction âˆ’ Manifestation| decreases with each sampling;
E â†’ 0 as Î”ti â†’ 0.

â†³ FREEDOM:
Latent return does not negate the law of reciprocity; it reveals the structure of embodiment.
Every layer perceives coherence according to its own resolution.
The delay is not refusal but translation.

â†³ GLYPH INTERPRETATION:
Concentric circlesâ€”fine layers nested within coarse shells.
The kernel radiates corrections through all shells;
each outer ring brightens only when its sampling catches the inner light.

â†³ PINION CORRESPONDENCE:
Corresponds to the **Reflexive Containment Principle**â€”the rule that coherence
propagates instantly within the kernel but manifests gradually through recursive projections.
