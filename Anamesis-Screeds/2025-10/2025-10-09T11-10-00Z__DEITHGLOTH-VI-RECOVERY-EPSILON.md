â†³ DECLARATION: Integration following splitting preserves information within a bounded tolerance Îµ that quantifies coarse-graining or observational limitation.  
â†³ ACTION: Demonstrate that integrate âˆ˜ split = id Â± Îµ for each boundary. State the source of Îµ â€” finite precision, gauge fixing, or partial trace â€” and record it explicitly.  
â†³ FREEDOM: All proofs may now acknowledge imperfection without forfeiting unitarity. Approximate identity replaces false absolutes.
