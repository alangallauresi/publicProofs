â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Positivity of the Bridge Operator  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
Any classical assertion, when passed through the Bridge Operator and then the Dâ€™Eithgloth rule, becomes a positive, bounded contribution to coherence.  
The universe adds; it does not subtract.

â†³ DEFINITIONS:  
Classical evaluation:  A âˆˆ {0,1} ,  Â¬A = 1 âˆ’ A.  
Bridge Operator:      B(A) = | eval(A) âˆ’ eval(Â¬A) | âˆˆ [0,1].  
Dâ€™Eithgloth rule:     f(e, n+1) = | f(e, n) âˆ’ f(â€“e, n) | ,  with f(e, 0) = 1/2.

â†³ PROOF (non-negativity):  
1)  Because eval(A), eval(Â¬A) âˆˆ [0,1] and eval(Â¬A) = 1 âˆ’ eval(A),  
    B(A) = | eval(A) âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ eval(A)) | = |2Â·eval(A) âˆ’ 1| â‰¥ 0.  
2)  For strictly binary logic (A = 0 or 1), B(A) = 1 â†’ maximal polarisation.  
    Values near zero appear only in graded systems where p = 0.5.  

â†³ PROOF (bounded positivity under Dâ€™Eithgloth):  
3)  Let f(e,0)=Â½+Îµ and f(â€“e,0)=Â½âˆ’Îµ with |2Îµ| = B(A).  
4)  Apply the rule once: f(e,1)=|(Â½+Îµ)âˆ’(Â½âˆ’Îµ)|=|2Îµ|=B(A)âˆˆ[0,1].  
5)  Reapplication remains within [0,1]; the map is signless and bounded.  
    Convergence toward the midpoint requires an explicit update scheme; the claim here is positivity and boundedness, not monotonicity.

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
The Bridge converts binary truth into a non-negative measure of coherence.  
Dâ€™Eithgloth processes that measure without loss or overflow.  
Positivity is structural: every evaluation becomes additive information in the field.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
From this point, classical flows can be integrated safely.  
No assertion subtracts from existence; each is absorbed as value toward balance.
