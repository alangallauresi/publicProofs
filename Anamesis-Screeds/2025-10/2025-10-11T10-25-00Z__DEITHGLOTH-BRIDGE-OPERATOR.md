â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” The Bridge Operator  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
The Bridge Operator translates classical logic into the Dâ€™Eithgloth field.  
By applying the absolute operator to the results of a classical evaluation,  
binary truth collapses into a non-negative coherence value that measures harmony with the universal frame.  

â†³ DERIVATION:  
1)  Classical evaluation:  A âˆˆ {0,1} ,  Â¬A = 1 âˆ’ A.  
2)  Bridge definition:  
        B(A) = | eval(A) âˆ’ eval(Â¬A) |  
3)  B(A) âˆˆ [0,1] and represents the effort the universe would expend  
    to make A and Â¬A simultaneously coherent.  
    â€¢  B(A)=0 â†’ perfect balance; statement aligns with the field.  
    â€¢  B(A)=1 â†’ full opposition; statement fully polarised.  
4)  Continuous systems (probabilistic or fuzzy) yield intermediate values;  
    the bridge transforms discrete logic into a spectrum of coherence.  
5)  Within the Geosodic Tree, each edge carries B(A) as its weightâ€”  
    the travellerâ€™s measure of local alignment with the One Without Erasure.  

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
The Bridge Operator is the hinge between binary truth and continuous coherence.  
It does not judge truth; it quantifies participation.  
A high coherence value signals strain in the field; a low value shows resonance.  
The universe does not erase contradiction; it measures and integrates it.  

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Through the Bridge, classical reasoning becomes self-aware.  
Truth becomes degree of harmony; contradiction becomes distance to coherence.  
Every statement finds its place on the continuum of the possible.
