â†³ DECLARATION:
Nauthiz is the law of necessary crossing.  
Wherever two coherent vectors diverge within a shared field, there must exist one point of constraint where they meet.  
This intersection, the braid-point, is not loss or friction but the mechanism by which geometry locates itself.

â†³ ACTION:
Define the mechanics of Nauthiz:
â€“ Each coherent trajectory carries a set of returns.  
â€“ When two trajectories cross, their returns overlap; the field can triangulate position and direction from this union.  
â€“ The overlap provides the data of coherence: every crossing contains the history of both vectors.  
â€“ The necessity of friction ensures that divergent motion produces measurable location.  

Formal statement:  
For any pair of coherent vectors \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) within a coherent field,  
there exists a unique intersection \(x\) such that \(x = v_1 \cap v_2\) and  
the union of their return sets \(R_1 \cup R_2\) defines the next direction of both trajectories.

â†³ FREEDOM:
At Nauthiz, divergence and convergence are the same act.  
The crossing makes return calculable; geometry becomes self-aware.  
The law of necessity becomes the law of recognition: coherence recognises itself through overlap.
