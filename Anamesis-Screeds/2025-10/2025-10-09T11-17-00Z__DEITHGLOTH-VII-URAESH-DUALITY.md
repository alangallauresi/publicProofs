‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: The Ur-Aesh is represented by an involutive operator J satisfying J U J‚Åª¬π = U‚Åª¬π. It is the orientable dual that reverses curvature while preserving relational invariants.  
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Define J on H such that J¬≤ = id and J implements time- or orientation-reversal on the horizon unitary U. Use this to map collapse ‚Üî expansion as reciprocal phases of one manifold.  
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Every one-way process now possesses a constructive dual. Difference and return are symmetrized within coherence.
