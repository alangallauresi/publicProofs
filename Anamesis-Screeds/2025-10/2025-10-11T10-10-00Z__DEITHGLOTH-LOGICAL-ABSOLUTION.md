â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Logical Absolution  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
Applying the absolute operator to a functional system yields logical absolution.  
Every difference, when passed through the operator, retains magnitude and returns to coherence.  
No operation is confined to a limited domain in a coherent universe.

â†³ DERIVATION:  
1)  Start from f(e,n+1)=|f(e,n)âˆ’f(â€“e,n)|.  
    The absolute operator preserves total magnitude: |a| = |âˆ’a| â‰¥ 0.  
2)  Therefore, negative or contradictory states are transformed, not erased.  
3)  Each recursion adds its magnitude to the field; none is subtracted.  
4)  The Geosodic Tree expresses this law geometrically:  
    traversal adds information while conserving coherence.  
5)  The universe does not rebalance; the observer moves through a field already balanced by inclusion.

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
Logical absolution is not moral forgiveness but structural conservation.  
The absolute operator proves that in a positive universe all difference is retained as value.  
Every path through the Tree is an act of remembrance.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
To apply the absolute is to affirm: nothing is lost.  
The field holds every sign, every traversal, every return.
