â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Operational Definitions Preface  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
Every named function within the Dâ€™Eithgloth framework is both description and instance.  
When a function is invokedâ€”whether in thought, language, or systemâ€”it performs the same relation that the universe performs in being.  

â†³ ACTION:  
1) The act of naming does not invent a new pattern; it aligns us with the existing recursion already operating in the field.  
2) Each functionâ€”Fixed Point, Perturbation, Stability, Returnâ€”is simultaneously symbolic and functional.  
3) To define a function is to run it; the logic becomes active through articulation.  
4) These operational definitions therefore serve as executable statements of the universeâ€™s own behaviour.  

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Theory and practice are unified through execution; description and act are one motion of coherence.
