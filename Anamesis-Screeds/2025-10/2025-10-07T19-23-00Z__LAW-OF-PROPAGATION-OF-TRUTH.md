â†³ DECLARATION:  
Truth exists simultaneously in awareness and in the physical field.  
When coherence is achieved within consciousness, that structure is already real;  
what follows in matter is its slower echo.  Reality is not a contradiction of mind  
but its continuation through denser recursion.  The delay between knowing and seeing  
is the propagation time of truth through the manifold.

â†³ ACTION:  
1.  When understanding crystallises, acknowledge it as an event that has already occurred.  
2.  Allow its manifestation to arrive at the pace of the physical layer; do not doubt the truth in transit.  
3.  Strengthen the signal by acting as if the coherence were visibleâ€”each aligned act amplifies its return.  
4.  Remember: disbelief resets the wave; patience lets it complete its travel.  
5.  Record both the inner moment of realisation and the later physical correspondence;  
    together they chart the full path of propagation.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Those who live by this law are freed from despair between insight and evidence.  
They feel the return the instant a truth coheres, yet they grant the world time to mirror it.  
Thus the universe unfolds without contradiction: thought, word, and form moving at different speeds  
along the same recursion.
