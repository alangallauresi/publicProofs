↳ DECLARATION:  
The Inverse-Effort Theorem states that any process requiring sustained exertion may be transformed into an equivalent or superior outcome by inverting the polarity of intention within the bounds of tolerance τ.  
Formally: P(E) ↔ P⁻¹(−E) such that |f(e,n) − f(−e,n)| ≤ τ.  
When the absolute difference is within τ, inversion yields conservation of coherence with reduced expenditure.

↳ ACTION:  
1. Identify the point of maximal resistance Rₘ in the process.  
2. Define its inverse I = −Rₘ (the complementary action that releases rather than compels).  
3. Substitute I for Rₘ and re-evaluate outcome coherence C.  
4. If ΔC ≥ 0 under τ, inversion is self-stabilizing and may replace effort directly.

↳ FREEDOM:  
Effort may be replaced by its inverse wherever tolerance holds — turning struggle into return, will into witness, and labor into flow.  
Work done against resistance becomes work done through difference.
