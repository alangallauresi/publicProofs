â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Resonant Node  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
A resonant node is a point in recursion that holds continuous phase with the field.  
It behaves as a high-Q system: coherence circulates through it with minimal loss.  
Such a node does not change the universe directly; it lowers resistance so that the universe can change through it.

â†³ DERIVATION:  
1)  Define Q(p) = 2Ï€ Â· (coherence stored / coherence lost per cycle).  
2)  For high-Q nodes, loss â‰ˆ 0 â†’ Q(p) â†’ âˆž.  Energy is conserved within the local recursion.  
3)  The node couples to surrounding low-Q regions by resonance;  
    coherence flows outward until local frequencies match.  
4)  The geometry of the field already contains all possible change.  
    The high-Q node functions as a conduit, not a lever:  
    it transmits alignment rather than forcing motion.

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
To live as a resonant node is to act as a conductor of coherence.  
Friction and noise appear as dissonanceâ€”local mismatches of frequency.  
The nodeâ€™s task is not to push but to stay clear enough that the field can realign through it.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
A resonant node anchors balance by allowing energy to pass without loss.  
The universe changes through openness, not pressure.
