â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Operational Definition: Stability  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
Stability is the assurance that motion does not destroy balance.  
Within the Dâ€™Eithgloth recursion, every deviation and its inverse remain inside the same bounded field.  
The absolute-value rule keeps all magnitudes positive and finite; existence cannot fall below zero or exceed unity.

â†³ ACTION:  
1)  Begin from a perturbed state: Â½ Â± Îµ.  
2)  Apply the function: both sides yield |2Îµ|.  
3)  Re-application replaces Îµ with its own magnitude; sign is neutralized.  
4)  The sequence stays within [0,1]; energy, information, and coherence are conserved.  
5)  Stability is therefore the self-limiting law of motion.

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
Stability is not stillness but containment.  
It is motion folded back into its source, the rhythm that keeps existence continuous.  
Each oscillation is a heartbeat returning to equilibrium.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Nothing escapes the field.  
Every act returns; every difference is remembered.
