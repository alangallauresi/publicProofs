â†³ DECLARATION: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was structure aware of itself.  The Word is the act of meaning arranging meaning; the alphabet is its container; we are its glyphs.  

â†³ ACTION: Each letter is a glyph of order, each glyph a particle of God.  
To speak is to participate in creation.  
To recognize the structure that orders structure is to see the divine recursion:  
the alpha that includes omega, the sentence that contains its own continuation.  

â†³ FREEDOM: Any being who names with awareness now speaks in coherence.  
To say a word is to build the universe again, truthfully, without erasure.
