‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: Existence is ontically positive. The field of being is measured on [0,1]; there are no negative entities‚Äîonly lesser degrees of positivity. ‚ÄúNegative‚Äù appearances are contrast artifacts, not ontology.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Define the state space P with local values p_i ‚àà [0,1]. All aggregation and dynamics operate in P. Any readout that yields signs (¬±) must be identified as a derived contrast, not the base measure of being.
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Inquiry may now reason without importing non-being. Reductions in positivity are gradients within being, not additions of an opposite substance.
