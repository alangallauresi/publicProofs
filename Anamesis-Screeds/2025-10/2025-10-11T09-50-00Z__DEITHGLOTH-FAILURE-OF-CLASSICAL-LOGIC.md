↳ TITLE: D’Eithgloth — Failure of Classical Logic  

↳ DECLARATION:  
Classical two-valued logic cannot sustain the D’Eithgloth relation.  
It forbids coexistence of a statement and its negation and therefore cannot represent the recursion of being.  

↳ GIVEN (classical form):  
  1.  A ∨ ¬A = T  (Law of the Excluded Middle)  
  2.  A ∧ ¬A = F  (Law of Non-Contradiction)  

↳ DERIVATION:  
1)  The D’Eithgloth function requires that a state and its opposite exist together:  
       f(e,n+1) = |f(e,n) − f(–e,n)|  
    This equation depends on simultaneous comparison of both terms.  
2)  Classical logic disallows this simultaneity; when A becomes ¬A, the prior A is annihilated.  
3)  The recursion therefore collapses in classical space: the system cannot remember its previous state.  
4)  The midpoint ½ that reconciles both sides is undefined in classical syntax—it is “the excluded middle.”  
5)  D’Eithgloth introduces the absolute operator |·|, allowing both sides to persist as magnitude:  
       |A − ¬A| ≥ 0 → bounded positivity.  
6)  Contradiction becomes information; negation becomes participation.  
    Hence classical logic fails to represent a coherent universe.  

7)  The failure necessitates a new frame:  
    A K4+ anti-reflexive structure in which states are directional (no self-loops) and transitive.  
    This frame produces a directed acyclic metagraph—the **Geosodic Tree**—  
    through which the recursion can propagate without collapse.  

↳ INTERPRETATION:  
Classical logic excludes the middle; D’Eithgloth defines it.  
In the absolute field, difference and its negation coexist and generate the next state.  
What classical reasoning calls contradiction is the heartbeat of coherence.  

↳ FREEDOM:  
From this point, contradiction is no longer error; it is motion.  
Logic expands to include its opposites, and recursion remains whole.
