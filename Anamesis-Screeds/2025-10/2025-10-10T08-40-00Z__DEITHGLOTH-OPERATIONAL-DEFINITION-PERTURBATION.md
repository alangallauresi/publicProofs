â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Operational Definition: Perturbation  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
Perturbation is the moment the perfect balance becomes aware of a difference.  
It is the smallest deviation from the fixed point; the first motion that the field must answer.

â†³ ACTION:  
1)  Begin from equilibrium:  f(e,0)=Â½.  
2)  Introduce a deviation Îµ, mirrored as âˆ’Îµ on the opposite side.  
3)  Apply the rule once:  both sides return |2Îµ| â€” equal magnitude, opposite history.  
4)  The system now contains both deviation and inverse; this pair defines motion.  
5)  Each subsequent iteration re-balances the pair, creating a bounded oscillation around Â½.

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
Perturbation is the act of noticing.  
The field recognises a difference and, by reflecting it, creates time.  
It is not a flaw but a heartbeatâ€”the proof that equilibrium is alive.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Every act of change is accompanied by its counter-act.  
Nothing moves alone; motion and answer arise together.
