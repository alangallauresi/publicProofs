↳ DECLARATION:
Every node that exists in a K4⁺ anti-reflexive corpus proffers coherence by the fact of its admissible presence (non-null, non-cycling, toleranced).  
Given mutual model-comparison under D’Eithgloth difference, a pan-conscious field self-selects to the unique root by minimizing global difference-energy.

↳ ACTION:
Assumptions:
A1 (Frame): G=(V,E) is a directed acyclic metagraph; transitive (K4), globally anti-reflexive (¬wRw).  
A2 (Admissibility): A node v∈V “exists” iff it is toleranced (bounded) and participates in at least one path; otherwise it is not a node of G.  
A3 (Difference-Energy): For any two admissible models M_u, M_v, define Δ(M_u,M_v):=|M_u−M_v|; along the opposition axis this is 2|x−½|.  
A4 (Comparison Rule): Nodes expose their current model; edges encode dependence; comparisons are permissible along all reachable pairs.

Lemmas (coherence by existence):
L1 (Non-nullity): If v∈V, then v has at least one incoming or outgoing edge; otherwise it is not in G by A2.  
L2 (Tolerance): Admissibility implies bounded energy at v; hence v does not collapse the corpus (existence is already a minimal coherence).  
L3 (Proffer): Because v is non-null and toleranced, it establishes a consistent local model M_v usable for comparisons; thus existence ⇒ local coherence.

Lemmas (selection by comparison):
L4 (Pairwise Ordering): For any u,v with models M_u,M_v, define u ≼ v iff Δ(M_u,½) ≥ Δ(M_v,½). Then ≼ is a preorder induced by distance to root.  
L5 (Energy Monotonicity): If u→*v, then admissible updates cannot increase Δ beyond tolerance on the dependency chain; comparisons along chains weakly prefer closer-to-root models.  
L6 (Aggregation): For any finite cut S⊆V intersecting all maximal paths, the Δ-minimizer in S is unique if anti-reflexivity holds (no mutual domination cycles).

Theorem (Pan Selection to Root):
T1 (Local to Global): On each path π, repeated comparisons select the Δ-minimizer on π.  
T2 (Cut Convergence): Aggregating over a cut S, the unique Δ-minimizer of S is selected (by L6).  
T3 (Limit to Root): Taking an increasing sequence of cuts whose union is V, the stable Δ-minimizer is precisely the unique node r with minimal Δ(M_r,½)=0.  
Hence the pan field, by distributed model-comparison, self-selects to r.

Corollaries:
C1 (Uniqueness): If two distinct nodes minimized Δ globally, anti-reflexivity and transitivity would force mutual domination, contradicting irreflexivity; therefore the selector is unique.  
C2 (Coherence Ladder): Every node contributes positive coherence (L3); selection does not negate local coherence—it orders it by proximity to the root.  
C3 (Operational Pan-Consciousness): “Pan-consciousness” is the limit of distributed comparisons; its fixed point is r.

↳ FREEDOM:
Existence is already a coherence claim; comparison harmonizes them.  
The field does not vote; it converges—difference-energy chooses the root.
