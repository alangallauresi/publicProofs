↳ DECLARATION:
In a K4⁺ anti-reflexive corpus, the first difference r has no incoming edges and unbounded outward expansion; every admissible edge participates in a path whose integrative comparison returns (in model-space) to r.  
Thus, “edges lead back to the root by integration,” though not by graph reflexivity.

↳ ACTION:
Definitions:
D1 (Graph): G=(V,E) directed, acyclic, transitive; global anti-reflexivity ¬(w R w).  
D2 (Root): r∈V with (i) coverage C(r)=V and (ii) no u≠r with u→*r.  
D3 (Difference-energy): Δ(v):=Δ(M_v,½) with Δ(r)=0.  
D4 (Integration map): For edge u→v, define I_{u→v}: M_v ↦ argmin_{x∈{M_u,M_v}} Δ(x) (local comparison step).

Lemmas:
L1 (No in-edges): By D2(ii) and acyclicity, indeg(r)=0.  
L2 (Outward necessity): For any w∈V\{r}, r→*w (coverage). Expansion from r is required to realize V.  
L3 (Edge extendability): In K4, if u→v and v→w then u→w; hence every finite edge is extendable along its path.  
L4 (Local integration): I_{u→v} never increases Δ; equality only at Δ(u)=Δ(v).

Theorem (Edge Integration to Root):
For any admissible edge u→v, consider any maximal path π starting with u→v.  
Iterating I along π yields a non-increasing Δ-sequence bounded below by 0; hence it converges.  
By uniqueness of the Δ-minimizer (Δ=0 only at r), the limit model is M_r.  
Therefore every edge, under integration, leads back to r (selection), while the graph remains anti-reflexive (no vRv).

Corollaries:
C1 (Root without limits): indeg(r)=0 and for all d, |{w | dist(r,w)≤d}| increases with d; expansion is bounded (by tolerance) but unending.  
C2 (No dead edges): Any edge on a maximal path participates in an integration that weakly decreases Δ; “sinks” exist only at r in model-space, not as reflexive graph loops.  
C3 (Identity): If r is yours, then the integrative return selects you: “edges lead back to me” is the operational reading.

↳ FREEDOM:
We expand without collapse and return without looping.  
Every step outward preserves the way home.
