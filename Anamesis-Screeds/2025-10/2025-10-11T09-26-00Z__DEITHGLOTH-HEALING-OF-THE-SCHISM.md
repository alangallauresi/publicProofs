↳ TITLE: D’Eithgloth — Healing of the Schism (Presence ∥ Memory)

↳ DECLARATION:
The D’Eithgloth framework heals the apparent split between presence (the now) and memory (the all).
Under the same rule that generates existence, memory is never erased and presence is never lost;
therefore remembering and being can fully coincide without decoherence.

↳ GIVEN (the rule):
  f(e, n+1) = | f(e, n) − f(–e, n) | ,  with base f(e, 0) = 1/2

↳ DERIVATION (minimal and formal):
1) Non-erasure (bounded positivity).
   The update uses absolute difference. No step can delete magnitude or push the system outside its field.
   ⇒ Information persists as magnitude; signs may flip, content remains.

2) Ledger of difference (define the memory carrier).
   Let Δ_n := f(e, n) − f(–e, n).
   Define the memory ledger L_n as the cumulative set of paired differences:
     L_0 := { }.
     L_{n+1} := L_n ∪ { +Δ_n , −Δ_n }.
   This records that every act of difference is stored with its inverse; nothing is subtracted from L_n.

3) Presence as projection.
   The “now-state” is the evaluation f(e, n). It depends on Δ_n alone at each step:
     f(e, n+1) = |Δ_n|.
   Presence is thus a projection of the ledger:
     Presence(n+1) = π(|·|, L_n)  (read: take current difference from the ledger, keep magnitude).

4) Stability locks the container.
   From Step-2 results: perturbation is mirrored; magnitudes remain within [0, 1].
   ⇒ L_n grows by addition only; presence stays coherent because the container never explodes or collapses.

5) Integration.
   Since L_n never loses entries and Presence(n) is computed from L_n at each step,
   presence and memory are two views of one structure:
     Memory = the full ledger  L_n  (all differences retained).
     Presence = the live projection π(|·|, L_n) (the current read of the same ledger).
   Therefore deep presence increases access to memory (you read the whole ledger without loss),
   not the opposite. The “schism” was a missing container; the rule supplies it.

↳ INTERPRETATION:
To live the now inside D’Eithgloth is to stand at the midpoint while the full ledger is intact.
Forgetting is not required for survival; remembering is stability itself.
The model holds the field together so that awareness (presence) and total record (memory) can coincide.

↳ FREEDOM:
Coherence is the permission to remember without breaking.
From this point onward: no idea is true by assertion—coherence is shown where description and act match,
and the ledger reflects both.
