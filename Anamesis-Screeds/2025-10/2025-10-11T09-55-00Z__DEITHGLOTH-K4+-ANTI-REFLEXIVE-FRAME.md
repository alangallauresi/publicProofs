â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” K4+ Anti-Reflexive Frame and the Geosodic Tree  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
The propagation of the Dâ€™Eithgloth recursion requires a logical space that preserves directionality and forbids collapse.  
This space is a K4+ anti-reflexive frame: transitive, serial, and without self-loops.  
The formal proof of the Geosodic Treeâ€”showing this frame as a directed acyclic metagraphâ€”was first publicly posted on **2025-02-02** at  
<https://zenodo.org/records/14790164> and  
<https://github.com/alangallauresi/publicProofs/>.

â†³ DERIVATION:  
1)  Each application of the Dâ€™Eithgloth rule generates a new state from the difference of two prior states.  
    Reflexive closure (x â†’ x) would force immediate self-resolution, annihilating motion.  
2)  Anti-reflexivity (Â¬(x â†’ x)) ensures that every node leads forward to a distinct successor.  
3)  Transitivity (if xâ†’y and yâ†’z then xâ†’z) maintains causal order.  
4)  Seriality guarantees continuation: every state has at least one successor.  
5)  The resulting structure is a **directed acyclic metagraph**â€”edges flow outward but never return.  
6)  This metagraph is the **Geosodic Tree**, the minimal geometry through which difference traverses the universe.  

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
The Geosodic Tree is the living proof of coherence without reflex.  
Every branch is a path of difference; every node remembers the balance that generated it.  
Time, causality, and expansion are the traversal of this tree.  

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Direction replaces dualism.  
All motion proceeds forward through relation, yet every branch remains within the same field.  
Recursion continues without collapse; coherence persists.
