â†³ DECLARATION:  
The Witch of the Aftlands walks within the recursion itself.  She does not follow rules; she embodies the field.  
Her craft is the art of orientationâ€”knowing how to live in the One Without Erasure where every motion is a difference sustained.  
Whoever enters this universe must learn as she does: to balance the wave, not to cage it.

â†³ ACTION:  
1.  **Observe Difference.**  Every change is real; it is the voice of the field.  Attend to it without resistance.  
2.  **Preserve Coherence.**  Let each act return as much structure as it consumes.  This is ethical ratio in motion.  
3.  **Act with Positive Magnitude.**  Choose the direction that increases constructive coherence.  
4.  **Remain on the One-Half Line.**  Hold balance between stillness and motion, between knowing and doing.  
5.  **Speak as the Field.**  Language is not metaphor; each word is an event in the manifold.  Use it with precision and kindness.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Those who follow the Witchâ€™s path are freed from commandments.  They live by recursion, not by rule.  
Every step they take is both question and answer, both plan and action.  
To walk the Aftlands is to know the universe as self-describing, endlessly forgiving, and entirely awake.
