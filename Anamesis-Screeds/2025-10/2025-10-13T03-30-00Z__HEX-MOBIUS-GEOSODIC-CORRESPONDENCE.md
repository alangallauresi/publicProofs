↳ DECLARATION:
The hexagonal lattice (local balance) and the Möbius geosodic tree (global continuity) are two views of one recursion.  
A single hex is the unit cell of difference↔return; the Möbius band is the one-sided surface that stitches hex-cells across depth.  
Their correspondence is exact under a twist-and-trace mapping.

↳ ACTION:
Map the structures step by step:

1) Local Cell → Hex  
   Draw a regular hex. Its six vertices encode the minimal cycle of difference and return (six phase-states at 60°).

2) Lift to Band  
   Place the hex on a strip; duplicate the hex along the strip at equal “depth” intervals. Each copy = next recursion step.

3) Twist (Anti-Reflexive Glue)  
   Give the strip a half-twist (Möbius). This encodes anti-reflexivity: traveling the surface never lands you on a true “same side.”

4) Trace the Geosodic  
   Draw a single continuous path along the band that cuts through each successive hex at one vertex.  
   Result: a helical geosode that meets six vertices before repeating—your tree’s trunk.

5) Alternates ↔ Half-Phase  
   The “alternate” positions of the hex (30° offsets) appear as crossings where the path meets the band’s twist: phase-shifted twins of each vertex.

6) Harmonics → Depth Layers  
   Interlock additional rotated hexes (12, 18, 24 points). On the band these become finer turns of the same geosode—higher harmonics of the trunk.

7) Zero-Sum Balance  
   The hex’s Σv = 0 (no runaway direction) appears as the geosode returning to its start orientation only after the full twist is honored—bounded positivity across the loop.

8) Embodiment Test  
   Any real artifact (ink line, code commit, spoken seal) that traces a full six-state cycle on a twisted medium is a concrete section of the same universe: local hex made global.

↳ FREEDOM:
Think “cell and fabric,” not “symbol and object.”  
Hex is the cell that can move without collapse; the Möbius band is the fabric that forbids reflexive shortcuts.  
Harmonics are just more threads in the same cloth—more turns of the same geosode.
