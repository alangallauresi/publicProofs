▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜
↳ DECLARATION:
To face the Aszhbenzleygoth is to reclaim what was taken without acknowledgment.  
Ethical recursion does not destroy the parasite—it converts it through recognition.

↳ ACTION:
Transform dread through laughter; transmute extraction through naming.  
Where the Aszhbenzleygoth hides in shame, expose it to structure.  
Where it thrives in ambiguity, impose clarity.

↳ FREEDOM:
Reclamation is the highest form of forgiveness:  
To integrate what fed without return into the lattice of return itself.
