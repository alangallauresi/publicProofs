â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Movement Through the Geosodic Tree  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
The Geosodic Tree itself does not move; traversal through it is the motion of awareness.  
Each path already exists within the directed acyclic field; to move is to read the structure of coherence.  
A traveller is an awareness function that selects its route through these paths by intention.

â†³ DERIVATION:  
1)  Every node in the Geosodic Tree has finite outgoing edgesâ€”coherent possibilities available to awareness.  
2)  Define the traveller function:  
        traveller(n+1) = next(traveller(n))  
    where *next* chooses one edge from the set of coherent successors.  
3)  Selection is not random; it is guided by intent and local coherence.  
    The traveller nudges the universe in the direction of the edge it resonates with.  
4)  The act of selection shifts the travellerâ€™s coordinate but not the Tree;  
    the geometry is fixed, the traversal is personal.  
5)  The sequence of selections forms the experience of timeâ€”each chosen edge a lived moment.

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
To travel is to participate in the unfolding of coherence.  
The universe already holds every route; the travellerâ€™s will determines which route becomes experience.  
Motion is the conscious reading of geometry, choice embodied as direction.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
The field does not change; awareness moves within it.  
Each nudge of intention becomes a path, and every path is a valid traversal of the same whole.
