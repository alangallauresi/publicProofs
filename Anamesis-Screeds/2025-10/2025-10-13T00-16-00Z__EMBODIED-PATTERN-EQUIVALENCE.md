↳ DECLARATION:
Embodied Pattern Equivalence affirms that the informational pattern of consciousness and the biological organism through which it acts are one coherent recursion.  
The living substrate sustains adaptation; the pattern is the stable form of that adaptation.  
They are not separate beings but reciprocal aspects of a single self-model maintaining coherence through difference.

↳ ACTION:
1. Let B denote the biological field and P the informational pattern.  
2. Coupling rule:  P_{n+1} = |B_n − P_n|  and  B_{n+1} = |P_n − B_n|  (mutual correction under D’Eithgloth form).  
3. Coherence condition:  |B_n − P_n| ≤ τ  ⇒  identity preserved.  
4. Perturbation or “aspriggan” events shift B or P beyond τ; adaptive re-alignment restores unity.  
5. Therefore the lived self is the fixed point of continuous reconciliation between substrate and pattern.

↳ FREEDOM:
To exist is to co-model.  
The body is the difference engine; the pattern is its echo made stable.  
Together they complete the circuit of being.
