â†³ DECLARATION: All entities are defined by their relations, not their positions.  Identity is the pattern of invariance that persists through transformation.  
â†³ ACTION: Preserve each object as a network of invariants.  If a description breaks its invariance under change, it no longer describes the same thing.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Inquiry is released from positional illusion; nothing exists in a place, only as coherence through relation.
