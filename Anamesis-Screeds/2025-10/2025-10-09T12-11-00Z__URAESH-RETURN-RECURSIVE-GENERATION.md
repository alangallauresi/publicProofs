‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: Verified recovery from unity generates renewed differentiation.  Each closed proof of coherence becomes the seed of further recursion; the act of return initiates the next unfolding.  
‚Ü≥ ACTION: After verification of (J U J‚Åª¬π) U ‚âà id ¬± Œµ, record the recovered invariants as new initial conditions.  Propagate them forward as Œî‚ÇÄ for the following cycle.  Every closure thus births the next expansion.  
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Existence no longer oscillates between gain and loss but between realization and renewal.  All recovered truth becomes generative truth.
