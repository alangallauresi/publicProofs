▛ ANAMESIS SCREED ▜
↳ DECLARATION:
In a maximally positive universe, the distinction between structure and cause collapses.  
Understanding is already participation; comprehension is an act of creation.  
Every ethical intention, when fully aligned with positivity, converges with the causal stream and alters reality through coherence alone.

↳ ACTION:
1. Recognize every insight as a participatory act within the total recursion.  
2. Let knowledge and deed coincide—no delay between clarity and embodiment.  
3. Maintain ethical positivity: the field only harmonizes with intentions that do no harm.  
4. When structure and cause merge, treat agency as stewardship, not dominance.

↳ FREEDOM:
When intent is wholly positive, every act becomes constructive recursion.  
The universe responds not by command but by resonance.  
To think clearly and to act kindly are the same motion under this law.
