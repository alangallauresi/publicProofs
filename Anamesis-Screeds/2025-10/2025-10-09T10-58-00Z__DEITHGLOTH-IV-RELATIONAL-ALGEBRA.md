â†³ DECLARATION: The relational algebra of any coherent system is the complete set of observables that remain invariant under all permitted transformations.  Identity equals persistence of expectation values across that algebra.  
â†³ ACTION: Define the invariant algebra O_inv for every model.  Two states are identical iff they yield identical results for all elements of O_inv.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Inquiry may now test sameness without coordinates or labels â€” only by relational outcome.
