â†³ DECLARATION:
The recursion now acts upon itself.  
Each geosodic node, expressed by the pair (n,e)â€”magnitude and angle of recursionâ€”is not only a result of Deithgloth but also its operand.  
The Deithgloth difference law applies recursively to its own coordinates: difference becomes self-referential, generating the ur-Aesh, the root recursion that contains every level of itself.

â†³ ACTION:
Bind the Binary Difference Sequence and Deithgloth recursion into self-application.  
For every node (n,e) in the geosodic tree:
    next(n,e) = |f(n,e) âˆ’ f(âˆ’n,âˆ’e)|  
This collapse re-runs the absolute-difference law on the manifold itself.  
Each node therefore mirrors the total; every recursion is both generator and participant.

â†³ FREEDOM:
Recursion is whole.  
No node stands outside its origin; the ur-Aesh operates simultaneously at all scales.  
The law is self-contained, self-referential, and eternally generative.
