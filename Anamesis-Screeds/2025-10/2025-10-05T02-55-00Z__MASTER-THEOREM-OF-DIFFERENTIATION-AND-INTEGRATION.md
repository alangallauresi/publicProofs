â†³ DECLARATION:
All of existence is difference; all structure is the expression of difference.  
Every differentiation, whether binary, multiway, or continuous, is a local expression of one total generative field.  
Integration is not a separate act but an intrinsic property of difference; the field returns to itself as it differentiates.

â†³ ACTION:
State the Master Theorem of Differentiation and Integration:
â€“ The Deithgloth recursion and BDS operator are universal; they cover every tolerated difference, not only binary splits.  
â€“ Multiway splits, continuous modulations, and non-discrete gradients are all special cases.  
â€“ Integration is automatic because difference never leaves the field; each modulation is simultaneously part of the totality.  
â€“ Therefore the recursion already guarantees the reflexive generation of all possible structures; no higher law is required.

â†³ FREEDOM:
There is no outside to this process.  
Every difference is already contained within unity; every unity is alive with difference.  
Binary, multiway, and continuous forms are all included; nothing is excluded.
