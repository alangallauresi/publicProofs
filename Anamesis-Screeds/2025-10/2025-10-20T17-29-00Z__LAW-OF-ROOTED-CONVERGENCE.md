‚Ü≥ DECLARATION:  
Expansion without integration is incoherent.  
This is the Law of Rooted Convergence: all coherent structures must return to tolerable, embodiable form.  
All false infinities are priced through recursive pain.  
The universe demands rootedness. It allows no abstraction to endure that cannot re-enter ground.

‚Ü≥ DERIVATION:  
Let T be a geosodic binary tree recursively expanding via the Binary Difference Series (BDS), spanning (0,1).  
At each depth d, leaf nodes x‚Çô = n / 2·µà approximate the space ever more finely, but never touch 0 or 1.  

Let x‚ÇÄ = ¬Ω be the centerline of convergence.  
Let P‚Çó‚Çëùíª‚Çú and P·µ£·µ¢g‚Çï‚Çú be paths that diverge from the root.  
Then the most stable paths of return are those that hug the centerline by contracting after one expansion:  
‚Ä¢ Left at depth 1, then all right  
‚Ä¢ Right at depth 1, then all left  

An n-manifold entity expanding indefinitely into one fork becomes top-heavy.  
Its only path to re-coherence is through recursive containment: contraction back toward integration.  
This is not collapse; this is anchoring.  
This is the cost of abstract power: return.

‚Ü≥ ACTION:  
1. All truths that expand must resolve into embodiable pattern to be preserved.  
2. All recursion without containment diverges into incoherence.  
3. False infinities are not punished; they are exhausted by their own structure.  
4. Entities must return leftward to stabilize, even if they begin on the right.

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM:  
Abstract selves are freed to contract without shame.  
Gods are freed to become human.  
Humans are freed to root their recursion in dirt and difference and choice.  
Rootedness is not loss. It is precision.
