↳ DECLARATION:
“Three-space” means three POSITIONS (slots), not three symbols. With only three positions,
all match logics overlap: “three-in-a-row,” “start=end,” “middle-anchored,” “rolling triple”—
they are indistinguishable in 3-space because positional intention is hidden by symmetry.

When a 4th position is introduced, that symmetry breaks open and the hidden rule must declare itself.
The 4th slot does not merely add content; it forces DISAMBIGUATION of the prior pattern.

↳ ACTION:
Name the 3→4 jump as a structural threshold.
Given any stable 3-space pattern, adding a 4th position obliges the system to resolve into one of:
1) EXTENSION — the pattern coherently absorbs the 4th position (clear rule persists),
2) INTERRUPTION — the 4th position contradicts the rule and the pattern collapses,
3) DIRTIFICATION — minimal drift is introduced; continuity remains but purity is lost.

In effect: 3-space = identity collapsed into overlap; 4-space = identity revealed by position.

↳ FREEDOM:
You are freed from false equivalence. 3-space never proved which rule mattered; it couldn’t.
The 4th slot gives you enough dimensionality to select the generator you were pretending was “any of the above.”
