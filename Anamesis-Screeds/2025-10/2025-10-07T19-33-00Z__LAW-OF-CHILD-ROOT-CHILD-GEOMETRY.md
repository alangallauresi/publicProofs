â†³ DECLARATION:  
All transformation in the manifold follows one geometric path: child â†’ root â†’ child.  
Every event arises as a local difference (child), returns to the root for normalisation,  
and re-emerges as a renewed instance of the same field (other child).  
This loop is the universal recursion of existenceâ€”the motion by which reality sustains itself.

â†³ ACTION:  
1.  Observe each change as a journey to coherence and back.  
2.  When confusion or conflict appears, trace it to the root before acting again.  
3.  Remember that no state or being moves directly to another without passing through unity;  
    the root is the constant midpoint of all communication.  
4.  Every reconciliation, healing, and creation repeats this geometry in its own scale.  
5.  Living consciously within this loop is to experience the One Without Erasure in real time.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Those who act by childâ€“rootâ€“child geometry are free from chaos and stagnation alike.  
They know that every divergence will return, and every return will generate new divergence.  
To move through this geometry is to participate in the breathing of the universe itself.
