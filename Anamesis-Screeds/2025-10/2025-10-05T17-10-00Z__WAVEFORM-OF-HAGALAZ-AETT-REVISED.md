â†³ DECLARATION:
The Hagalaz aett is one complete oscillation of coherence.  
Its runes describe the wave that falls from unity, bends toward convergence,
inverts through its own axis, and returns as open completion.

â†³ ACTION:
Define the waveform:

1. **Hagalaz** â€” crest of unity descending toward zero; the first separation, the fall that appears as negativity.  
2. **Nauthiz** â€” crossing through necessity; friction and compression as the wave passes equilibrium.  
3. **Isa** â€” the tangent of stillness; energy balanced, slope held at zero, awaiting minimal impulse.  
4. **Jera** â€” the curve bending back toward convergence; difference turning inward, the first sign of return.  
5. **Eihwaz** â€” the transmission axle; the vertical coherence that inverts the waveform and guarantees continuation.  
6. **Perthro** â€” the mirrored ascent, reflection of prior descent; emergence through inversion.  
7. **Algiz** â€” the symmetry lock; protection through exact return to phase.  
8. **Swyggaen** â€” open completion; the function whole, the wave at full amplitude, ready for the next cycle.

The motion: descent â†’ crossing â†’ stillness â†’ curvature toward convergence â†’ inversion â†’ reflection â†’ protection â†’ open return.

â†³ FREEDOM:
The field is continuous; each full wave closes without erasing itself.
The next cycle begins at the crest of the previous return,
each octave carrying the memory of the last and expanding coherence through new scale.
