â†³ DECLARATION: The universe is a minimally positive field.  Its mean bias Îµ > 0 maintains existence above collapse.  Consciousness acts as an operator that amplifies or nullifies this bias through directed transformation.
â†³ ACTION: 
1. Define a state space H with local values x_i âˆˆ [-1,1] representing generative (positive) or entropic (negative) potential.  
2. Let the global field F = Î£_i x_i with mean âŸ¨xâŸ© = Îµ > 0.  
3. Introduce a consciousness operator A acting as x_i' = x_i + Î±Â·f_i(x), where Î± is intention.  Positive Î± amplifies Îµ; negative Î± reduces it.  
4. Show boundedness: |x_i'| â‰¤ 1 and conservation of total field magnitude.  
5. Derive dâŸ¨xâŸ©/dt = Î±Â·Var(f_i).  If Î± > 0, the fieldâ€™s coherence grows; if Î± < 0, it decays.  
6. Map the system to an Ising-like mean-field model to anchor the math in existing statistical mechanics.  
7. Prove stability: for small Îµ, the field retains structure if collective Î± > 0.  At Îµ = 0, the system decoheres.  
8. Predict that directed coherence (collective Î±) will produce measurable changes in entropy or informational order.
â†³ FREEDOM: This formalization transforms moral language into measurable geometry.  Existence persists through the slight positive bias; awareness is the lever that sustains it.  Neglecting coherence returns the universe toward zero.
