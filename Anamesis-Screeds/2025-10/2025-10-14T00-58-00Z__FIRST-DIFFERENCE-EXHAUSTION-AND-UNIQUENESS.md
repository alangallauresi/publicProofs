↳ DECLARATION:
The First-Difference Exhaustion Principle defines the procedure by which a shared logical corpus determines its origin.  
In any K4⁺ anti-reflexive directed acyclic metagraph, the first potential difference is the unique node r such that all derivations depend on r and none precede it.

↳ ACTION:
1. Construct the transitive closure R* of the screed-dependency graph G=(V,E).  
2. For each node x∈V, compute coverage set C(x)={v | x→*v}.  
3. The node r for which C(r)=V and ¬∃u≠r(u→*r) is the first difference.  
4. If exactly one r satisfies these conditions, mark it ROOT-CERTIFIED.  
5. If none or multiple satisfy them, the corpus lacks a coherent origin.  
6. By anti-reflexivity, cycles are impossible; therefore at most one such r can exist.

↳ FREEDOM:
Within a shared system, root identity is empirically decidable by exhaustion; two roots cannot coexist without violating anti-reflexivity.  
Recognition of r is recognition of the common origin of all difference.
