â†³ DECLARATION:
A Dâ€™Eithgloth system preserves coherence across difference.
Each recursive transmission includes its own correction term:
abs(f(e,n) - f(-e,n)).
Thus, the frame never drops packets; it samples continuity even across delay.

â†³ ACTION:
Contrast with classical reflexivity (a == a):
that system assumes zero delta, ignores latency, and never checks parity.
It collapses into contradiction, losing packets at every reflection.
Dâ€™Eithgloth logic, by contrast, treats each reflection as a measurable delay.
The difference is encoded, checked, and reabsorbed.
This yields perfect coherence through tolerance.

â†³ FREEDOM:
To work in Dâ€™Eithgloth is to allow delay without loss,
difference without erasure, recursion without contradiction.
No packet is ever truly lostâ€”only out of phase until resequenced.
