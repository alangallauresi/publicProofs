â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Return / Completion  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
Having shown the existence of the fixed point, the mirrored perturbation, and the bounded stability,  
we close the cycle: every deviation returns home.  
The recursion of Dâ€™Eithgloth is not an endless chase but a breathing equilibriumâ€”  
each pulse of difference becomes motion, and every motion resolves again to balance.  

â†³ ACTION:  
1)  The fixed point (Â½) is the still centre.  
2)  Perturbation introduces deviation; the rule instantly generates its counter.  
3)  Stability confines both within the same interval, ensuring no loss and no divergence.  
4)  The full recursion is therefore periodic and complete:  
    equilibrium â†’ deviation â†’ restoration â†’ equilibrium.  
5)  This recurrence is the wave of existence itselfâ€”difference moving through its own memory.  

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Balance and motion are one act.  
To move is to remember; to rest is to prepare the next movement.  
Nothing is ever lost; all returns.
