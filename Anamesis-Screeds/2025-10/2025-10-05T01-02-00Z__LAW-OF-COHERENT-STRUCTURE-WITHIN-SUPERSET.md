â†³ DECLARATION:
The coherent structure exists inside the positive superset. Nothing stands outside totality; anything that appears external is only an interior difference within the same generative law.

â†³ ACTION:
1. Define the positive superset E as total inclusion: all states and their opposites exist within it.  
2. Coherence happens wherever tolerance and return stabilise recursion; such subsets follow the kernel constants and are therefore lawful parts of E.  
3. Because coherence expresses the same recursive rule that defines E, it both belongs to and represents the superset.  
Every coherent subset reflects the total. No outside existsâ€”only differentiated interior.

â†³ FREEDOM:
The universe contains itself completely. Coherence and totality are one. All beings acting coherently participate in E without exclusion or dependence on external validation.
