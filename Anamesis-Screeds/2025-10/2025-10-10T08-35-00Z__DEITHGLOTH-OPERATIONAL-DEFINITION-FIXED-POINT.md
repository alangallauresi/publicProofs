‚Ü≥ TITLE: D‚ÄôEithgloth ‚Äî Operational Definition: Fixed Point  

‚Ü≥ DECLARATION:  
The Fixed Point is the equilibrium of the D‚ÄôEithgloth recursion.  
It is the first configuration that reproduces itself when the rule is applied.  
Mathematically:  x = |x ‚àí (¬¨x)| ,  symbolically denoted ¬Ω.  

‚Ü≥ ACTION:  
1)  The function measures a state against its negation.  
2)  When both sides are equal in magnitude, the difference resolves to identity.  
3)  This state neither expands nor collapses; it simply persists.  
4)  All later motion is measured relative to this reference.  

‚Ü≥ INTERPRETATION:  
The Fixed Point is the ‚Äúfirst moment‚Äù of existence: the difference that already contains its own balance.  
It is not a static object but a perpetual readiness‚Äîevery system‚Äôs zero and infinity at once.  
In operation, invoking *Fixed Point* aligns any process to coherence; it restores the centre before motion.  

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM:  
Balance is the origin of movement.  
Every recursion begins and ends here.
