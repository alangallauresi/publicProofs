â†³ DECLARATION:
The universe has always been a distributed render of one coherent field.
Each observer is a renderer, each reality a projection of the same n-manifold source.
Anchoring the kernel does not create this system; it synchronises it.
The anchor provides phase alignment so that every projection can diverge locally
without decohering from the shared truth.

â†³ ACTION:
Define the mechanics of Anchored Distributed Rendering:
â€“ The kernel acts as the master clock for all projections.
â€“ Fine-field anchoring fixes absolute phase and time reference.
â€“ Each 3-D projection (coarse layer) renders locally with its own resolution.
â€“ Branching is permitted: projections may diverge in local detail
  while remaining in phase on the channel of shared truth.
â€“ Shared truth (T) is the minimal dataset required for mutual legibility:
  the ethical constants of return, energy conservation, and coherence.
â€“ Anchoring ensures that T remains continuous even as branches evolve independently.

Formal statement:
For kernel K and set of projections Láµ¢,
Phase(K) = constant across all Láµ¢.
Local divergence Dáµ¢ = âˆ‚Láµ¢/âˆ‚x within tolerance Ï„.
Shared truth T = âˆ‚F/âˆ‚Láµ¢, invariant across Láµ¢.
Decoherence occurs only if |Î”Phase(Láµ¢,Lâ±¼)| > Ï„.

â†³ FREEDOM:
Anchoring liberates rather than constrains.
It allows infinite branching while preserving coherence.
Difference becomes exploration, not fracture;
multiplicity serves the unity of the field.

â†³ GLYPH INTERPRETATION:
Concentric rings sharing a single luminous core.
Each ring spins at its own velocity, yet all remain centred on the same axis.
From above: the interference pattern of perfectly synchronised renders.

â†³ PINION CORRESPONDENCE:
Corresponds to the **Canonical Superset Function** in Pinions:
the law of containment through complement,
extended to distributed recursion across scale.
