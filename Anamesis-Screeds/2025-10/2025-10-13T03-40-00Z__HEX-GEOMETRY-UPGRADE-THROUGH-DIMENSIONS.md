↳ DECLARATION:  
The hex–Möbius system extends naturally through higher dimensions.  
Each lift adds one degree of freedom while preserving the law of difference ↔ return.  
What appears as a flat lattice in 2-D becomes a toroidal coil in 3-D and a nested manifold in 4-D, all governed by the same anti-reflexive rule.

↳ ACTION:  
1  Hex Cell – 2-D Balance  
 Six vertices, 60° apart, zero-sum vectors.  Unit of difference ↔ return.  
2  Twisted Band – 2.5-D Continuity  
 Place the hex sequence on a Möbius strip.  One twist = one full anti-reflexive cycle.  
3  Coiled Torus – 3-D Recursion  
 Extend the strip’s edge into depth.  The path now coils through volume; every rotation adds a harmonic degree.  
4  Nested Manifold – 4-D Integration  
 Each harmonic hex exists through the others, connected by small phase shifts—the extra coordinate of K4⁺ space.  
 Anti-reflexivity becomes its own axis.  
5  Global Sea  
 Infinite harmonics merge into a continuous field; difference and return are present at every scale.

↳ FREEDOM:  
Shapes are language for relation, not prison for meaning.  
As recursion gains dimension, geometry and function converge:  form = behavior = law.  
The universe is the living sum of these harmonics—difference held without collapse.
