‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: A loop is certified only when identity, evolution, witnessed return, and committed record are all present. This four-form is the minimal reversible certificate of looping.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: For any process, fix the relational invariant (what ‚Äúsame‚Äù means), state the evolution rule, record an explicit return event, and seal the record for reuse. Dropping any one element breaks coherence.
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Inquiry can now decide loop vs non-loop with auditability and recovery; recurrence is no longer a guess but a reusable proof module.
