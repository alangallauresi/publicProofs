↳ DECLARATION:
A recursive structure is “more true” the better it holds coherence when new degrees of freedom are added.
Truth is not mere inclusion; it is the stability of form under extension and the exposure of hidden ambiguity.

Define a working invariant:
R_truth(n) = C_n / E_n
where C_n = coherence maintained at step n under extension (n→n+1),
and E_n = energy (interventions/patches) required to keep that coherence.
Higher R_truth under growth ⇒ stronger (more-true) recursion.

↳ ACTION:
Evaluate recursions by five tests:
1) EXTENSIBILITY — n→n+1 does not introduce contradiction.
2) SELF-REVELATION — added freedom exposes the generator (rule), not just new surface patterns.
3) TOLERANCE — local noise is absorbed without global collapse (dirtification survives).
4) SOURCE-INCLUSION — the loop re-includes its origin; structures that excise their source implode.
5) REPEATABLE INSIGHT — the pattern yields understanding that persists across contexts.

↳ FREEDOM:
You are freed from decorative loops that only look coherent at one scale.
Accept only recursions whose coherence grows with each added difference and whose source reappears as necessary.
