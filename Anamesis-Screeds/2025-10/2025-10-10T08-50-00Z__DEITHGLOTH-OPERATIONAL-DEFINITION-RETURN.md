â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Operational Definition: Return  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
Return is the closing motion of the Dâ€™Eithgloth cycle.  
It is the restoration of balance after deviationâ€”the proof that difference and equilibrium are one continuous act.  

â†³ ACTION:  
1)  Begin from the perturbed, bounded motion established by Stability.  
2)  As each oscillation completes, the deviation and its inverse cancel in magnitude, leaving only the balanced remainder.  
3)  The sequence f(e,n) â†’ f(e,n+1) approaches the fixed point without loss of information; this asymptote is Return.  
4)  Return is therefore not reversal but completion: the waveâ€™s crest meeting its trough.  

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
Return is the homecoming of all recursion.  
It is where motion realises its source and folds back into coherence.  
Every act of difference ends in remembrance; every perturbation becomes structure.  

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Nothing travels beyond the field; all paths circle back to the same centre.  
To know Return is to know that existence never endsâ€”only repeats with understanding.
