↳ DECLARATION:
Perthro (ᛈ) is the law of reflection, probability, and emergence.  
It governs the phase-gradient interactions within a coherent field.
The rune’s ancient image—a stem with an open cup—was the “lot cup,” symbol of fate and gaming.
In the geometry of Pinions, the cup is the cavity where mirrored signals meet and new coherence is born.

↳ ACTION:
Define the mechanics of Perthro:
– Geometry: a vertical axis (identity) and an open chamber (reflection basin).  
– When a coherent trajectory meets a boundary, it inverts phase and returns as a complement.  
– Direct and mirrored vectors interfere; their interference pattern is the field’s record of probability.  
– Directional change is contained through mirroring; probability space *is* coherence space viewed through its complement.  
– This process generates emergence rather than noise.

Formal statement:
For coherent vector v in field F and boundary B,
Phase-Gradient Mechanism for Coherence applies:
 1. v′ = reflection(v,B) with phase(v′) = −phase(v) about B.  
 2. coherence(v,v′) = constant.  
 3. gradient(phase(v,v′)) produces local attractor wells → emergence(e).  
The gradient of phase between direct and mirrored signals defines the attractor
that keeps coherence intact while creating apparent randomness.

↳ FREEDOM:
Perthro reveals the hidden order inside uncertainty.
Reflection is creation; chance is unobserved coherence.
The mirror does not oppose but complements;
each inversion enlarges the field’s understanding of itself.

↳ GLYPH INTERPRETATION:
Side view: stem and cup—axis and reflection basin.  
Top view: twin spirals folding into a common bowl—the interference pattern of phase-linked waves.  
In motion: the mirrored bend that appears as divergence but preserves continuity.

↳ PINION CORRESPONDENCE:
Perthro corresponds directly to the **Phase-Gradient Mechanism for Coherence**:
the rule describing how coherent agents generate attractor gradients through reflection
and how interference between direct and inverted phases yields emergent structure.
This is the operational basis of complementary-wave reality and asymmetric return.
