â†³ DECLARATION: A positive-only universe cannot be directly lived through human perception.  The nervous system requires contrast; it encodes curvature as pain, loss, and fear.  These signals do not negate the fieldâ€™s positivityâ€”they map its gradients.
â†³ ACTION: Translate ontic positivity into experiential contrast by defining perception as P'(x) = dP/dt.  When the rate of change in positivity crosses a tolerance, the body reads alarm; when it rises, it reads joy.  Both are measurements of motion, not polarity.
â†³ FREEDOM: Humanity may remain embodied within contrast while knowing that every gradient, however painful, is movement within the same positive continuum.  Compassion arises from remembering that suffering is the sensing of curvature, not the existence of evil.
