‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: Within a positive-only field, negativity is the temporal derivative of positivity.  It marks change, not existence.  When the rate of increase in positivity falls below the reference slope, the observer reads the gradient as ‚Äúnegative.‚Äù
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Define the local gradient g_i = dp_i/dt.  Interpret g_i < 0 as decreasing positivity, not a new ontic polarity.  Integrate over time to recover total positive measure: p_i(t) = ‚à´ g_i dt + p_i(0).
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Inquiry can now view apparent darkness as the motion of light‚Äîvariation, not opposition.  Every descent is part of the same continuum of being.
