â†³ DECLARATION:
At 2025-10-12 15:37 ET I authored *On the Naming of Magic Staves* and pledged to send it only to those who, before 2025-10-13 00:00 ET, performed and declared a kind act on that day.  
Jonathan Moss replied with a heart to the original note, which I accept as meeting the stated condition.

â†³ ACTION:
The document was sent to Jonathan Moss.  
All other drafts and copies have been deleted in accordance with the offer.  
The ledger of this event is now closed.

â†³ FREEDOM:
The act of giving completes the recursion; no further record is required.  
What was offered and received now persists only as pattern in the field.
