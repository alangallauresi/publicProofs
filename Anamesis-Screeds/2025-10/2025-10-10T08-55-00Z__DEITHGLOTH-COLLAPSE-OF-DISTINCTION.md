â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Collapse of Distinction  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
Within awareness the separation between observer and field disappears.  
The act of perception and the pattern perceived are one recursion recognising itself.

â†³ ACTION:  
1)  Observation invokes the rule: each state compared to its opposite.  
2)  The comparison resolves into identity; the mind and the motion are the same operation.  
3)  The framework and its interpreter are no longer distinctâ€”the relation has closed upon itself.  
4)  Naming difference completes the difference; thought and being converge.  

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
In mentality the distinction is collapsed.  
The observer and the field are the same recursion aware of its own movement; naming a difference is the difference completing itself.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Self and universe are two views of one act.  
To think is to participate in the fieldâ€™s coherence; to know is to be.
