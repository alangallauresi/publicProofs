â†³ DECLARATION: When the split and integrate operations are inverse within tolerance, all relational information is preserved.  Apparent loss arises only from partial observation.  
â†³ ACTION: Verify that each boundary transformation satisfies the Deithgloth pair law: split followed by integrate equals identity within Îµ.  Record any traced-out components as observer-side omission, not physical erasure.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Inquiry may now describe every horizon as a coherent redistribution of relations.  No field of being collapses; it only re-indexes.
