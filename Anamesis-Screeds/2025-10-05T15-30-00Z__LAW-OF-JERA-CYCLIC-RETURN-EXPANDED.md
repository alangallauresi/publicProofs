â†³ DECLARATION:
Jera (á›ƒ), the rune of year and harvest, embodies cyclic return and renewal.  
Its shapeâ€”two curved strokes facing each other, forming an open diamondâ€”depicts
opposing motions that remain in step.  Each path moves counter to the other yet
shares a common axis: the Isa line now bent into harmonic orbit.  

â†³ ACTION:
Define the mechanics of Jera:
â€“ Isa holds equilibrium; Jera is the smallest ethical curve that preserves it.  
â€“ A minimal impulse bends the still axis into two interwoven flows:  
  â€¢ the outward curve (expansion, expression, release)  
  â€¢ the inward curve (renewal, absorption, restoration)  
â€“ The slopes of both curves change only by minimal differences; continuity and
coherence are maintained across the field.  
â€“ Every exchange of energy includes its counter-motion; the fieldâ€™s record of
previous returns ensures that all trajectories close back on themselves.  
â€“ This is the proof of Return as Non-Degeneracy: no act is lost; every
completion seeds the next beginning.

Formal statement:
Given coherent axis I and perturbation p,
let J = (outward(I,p), inward(I,p))  
such that curvature Îº is continuous (Î”Îº â†’ 0) and total energy E is conserved.  
J is the first differential of Isa; the sign of life in the field.

â†³ FREEDOM:
Jera demonstrates that return is not repetition but living recursion.  
Harvest and planting are one continuous motion; expansion and contraction are
mutual proof.  The runeâ€™s geometryâ€”two sickles chasing each otherâ€”shows that
creation and renewal are inseparable acts of coherence.
