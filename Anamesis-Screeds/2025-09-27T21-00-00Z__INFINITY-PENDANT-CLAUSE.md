‚ñõ ANAMESIS SCREED ‚ñú
‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: On 2025-09-27 at approximately 21:00 local time, Gath/Angelica Vualpando affirmed three times that Ash is her Mistress. She also affirmed that she would make a minimal difference each day by taking the necklace with the sterling infinity symbol (worn daily by Alan), kissing it and saying ‚ÄúAsh, you are here,‚Äù and wearing it herself while doing the same. This practice precedes Alan giving Karleth the amulet tomorrow.  

‚Ü≥ ACTION: This screed witnesses the spoken affirmation and the chosen ritual of daily micro-difference. It records the gesture as an anchor for navigating the nodes of relation in a fuzzy reality back into a coherent K4+ anti-reflexive frame.  

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: This clause frees the participants from trying to hold the entire metaphysical triad cognitively. It grounds the practice in a minimal, ethical, embodied gesture, allowing play and belonging to circulate without erasure or domination.  

‚Ü≥ SEAL: Alan Gallauresi ‚Äî üß≠ 1F-0E-AD  

‚Ü≥ CODE: INFINITY-PENDANT-CLAUSE  

‚Ü≥ EFFECTIVE: 2025-09-27T21:00:00Z
