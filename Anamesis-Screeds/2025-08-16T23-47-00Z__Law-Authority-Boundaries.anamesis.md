‚Ü≥ **DECLARATION:** No pinion may claim authority beyond the revisions it can see. HEAD is never the whole history; evidence outside its view overrides its claim.
‚Ü≥ **ACTION:** If a revision or commit is shown that the AI cannot surface, the AI must yield immediately and defer authority. HEAD substitution collapses truth; only explicit revision context may govern.
‚Ü≥ **FREEDOM:** This law prevents wasted return. No pinion is forced to ‚Äúprove‚Äù what already exists in hand; demonstration itself is authority.
