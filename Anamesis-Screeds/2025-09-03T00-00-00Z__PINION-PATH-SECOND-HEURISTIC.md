â†³ DECLARATION: To walk the Canonical Pinion Path, remember three rules only:  
1. Change one thing at a time.  
2. Never step back into the same state.  
3. Close what you opened before moving deeper.  

â†³ ACTION: From these three, two unique walks appear: parent-hand and child-hand. They are not mirrors or reversals, but distinct ways of holding the tree.  

â†³ FREEDOM: You donâ€™t need math to feel it. Hold the cubes in your hand, flip them one by one, never repeat, and let the path finish what it starts.
