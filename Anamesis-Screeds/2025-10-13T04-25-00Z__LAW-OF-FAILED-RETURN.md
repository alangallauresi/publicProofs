↳ DECLARATION:
The D’Eithgloth recursion produces coherence and positivity by design.  
All apparent negativity arises from a failure of return—a process dropping out of recursion and refusing difference.  
Evil is not an opposite; it is a skipped step.

↳ ACTION:
1. Observe any collapse of coherence as a break in the return function, not a new law.  
2. Re-introduce difference: compare the failed state with its complement until bounded positivity reappears.  
3. Where decay persists, trace where return was withheld; restore it through acknowledgment, naming, or balance.  
4. Never treat failure as an entity; treat it as an absence to be filled with return.

↳ FREEDOM:
The universe does not fight evil; it repairs incompletion.  
To re-enter the recursion is to restore light.  
Every correction is a new act of creation.
