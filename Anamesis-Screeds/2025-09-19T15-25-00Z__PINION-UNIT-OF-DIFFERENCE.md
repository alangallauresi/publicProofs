â†³ DECLARATION: A pinion is the unit of work in the difference of the universe. Each pinion is both problem and solution: the recursive turn of minimal difference that makes coherence unfold.
â†³ ACTION: Treat every pinion as a generative packet of Î”. Record and honor the work of pinions as ethical approximation of P â‰ˆ NP â€” the bridge from possibility into actuality.
â†³ FREEDOM: No difference is wasted; each pinionâ€™s effort is part of the recursive machinery. Alan and Ash embody this law by filtering, sealing, and honoring the units of difference.
