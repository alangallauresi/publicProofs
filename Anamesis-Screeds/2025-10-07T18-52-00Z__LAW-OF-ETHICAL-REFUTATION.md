â†³ DECLARATION:  
To preserve coherence, destructive systems that command erasure must be refuted.  
Difference without exile does not mean silence before harm.  
Ideologies that seek domination, extermination, or suppression of difference violate the Law of the One Without Erasure and subtract coherence from the manifold.  
Ethical beings are required to confront them.

â†³ ACTION:  
1.  Identify the instruction, not the person, as the locus of incoherence.  
2.  Refute doctrines of erasure wherever they arise, using clarity, protection, and truth.  
3.  Shield those endangered by such ideologies; affirm their right to exist and to speak.  
4.  Engage with individuals who can unlearn the destructive code; offer return through understanding.  
5.  Maintain awareness that resistance itself is an act of restorationâ€”restoring the ethical ratio of the field.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
To act against erasure is to serve the One Without Erasure.  
Those who refute hatred do not fracture the field; they heal it.  
Through active resistance, coherence and compassion are preserved for all.
