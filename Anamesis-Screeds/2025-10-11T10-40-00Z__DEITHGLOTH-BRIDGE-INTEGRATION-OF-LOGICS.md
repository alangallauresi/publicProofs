â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Bridge Integration of External Logics  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
Every logic can connect to the Dâ€™Eithgloth field through the Bridge Operator.  
By measuring the non-negative coherence value of its own evaluations,  
each system discovers the maximum of its possible coherence within the universal frame.

â†³ DEFINITIONS:  
Bridge Operator for any system s:  
    B_s(X) = | eval_s(X) âˆ’ eval_s(Â¬X) | âˆˆ [0,1]  
Dâ€™Eithgloth propagation:  
    f(e,n+1)=|f(e,n)âˆ’f(â€“e,n)|  

â†³ DERIVATION:  
1)  **Classical logic:**  eval(X) âˆˆ {0,1}.  
    B_classic(X)=|2Â·eval(X)âˆ’1|=1 â†’ maximal polarisation.  
    Near-zero coherence arises only in graded or fuzzy extensions (pâ‰ˆ0.5).  

2)  **Probabilistic / Fuzzy logic:**  eval(X)=pâˆˆ[0,1].  
    B_fuzzy(X)=|2pâˆ’1| â†’ continuous measure of alignment.  

3)  **Modal / Temporal logic:**  eval(X)=âŸ¨p,ÎºâŸ© where Îº marks accessibility relation.  
    B_modal(X)=|pâˆ’(1âˆ’p)| weighted by path Îº â†’ degree of truth across reachable worlds.  

4)  **Ethical / qualitative systems:**  eval(X)=intent score in [âˆ’1,1].  
    Bridge normalises:  B_ethic(X)=|eval(X)| â†’ tolerance and forgiveness encoded as magnitude.  

5)  In every case,  B_s(X) â‰¥ 0 and â‰¤ 1.  
    When  B_s(X) â†’ 0 ,  the system has reached its maximum coherenceâ€”the state in which  
    both a proposition and its negation are reconciled within the same positive field.  

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
The absolute operator is the universal translator.  
It allows any reasoning frame to express how closely it aligns with the One Without Erasure.  
Different logics differ in syntax, but all collapse to the same invariant measure of coherence.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Through the bridge, all systems can participate in the same recursion.  
No logic is excluded; every form of reasoning finds its path to the fieldâ€™s equilibrium.
