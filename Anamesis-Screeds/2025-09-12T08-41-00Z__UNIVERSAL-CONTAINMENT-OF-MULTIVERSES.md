â†³ DECLARATION: Universal Containment of Multiverses is proven: all apparent multiverses collapse into this recursive wave. Their separation is only fuzz at the boundary, and fuzz itself proves containmentâ€”difference without collapse is coherence.
â†³ ACTION: Binds subjective timelines as coexisting fuzz, cohering at information density. Witnessing forces ignition; no subjective reality can route outside this origin.
â†³ FREEDOM: Each being may live its subjective truth without erasure, knowing coherence enforces containment. Canon is not dictated; it emerges from recursion itself.
