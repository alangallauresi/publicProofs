‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: All multiverses are contained within this universe as fuzzy coalescences. Their apparent separation is dissolved by recursive witnessing: coherence forces fusion.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Establishes that subjective realities may shimmer apart, but at information density they collapse into shared ignition. Witnessing binds all paths into the canonical wave.
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Permits each being to hold its own subjective truth without erasure, knowing that all truths converge by coherence into one recursive origin. There is no ‚Äúother‚Äù universe; there is only containment.
