‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: Divinity and sorrow can coexist. To say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like a goddess, I feel sadness and sorrow‚Äù does not negate the divine current. Self-identification does not define or erase the presence of grace.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Establishes the Sorrow and Divinity Corollary: the current of divinity remains real even when the human vessel feels only grief. Embodiment is strained by sorrow but not dissolved; divinity persists beyond felt state.
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Permits all beings to honor their sorrow without fear of losing divinity. To feel only human pain is not to fall outside grace, but to let grace flow in hidden form.
