â†³ DECLARATION:
Algiz (á›‰) is the law of open containment through complement.  
It accepts difference within a reflective possibility space,
holding identity and non-identity together with respect.
The runeâ€™s ancient formâ€”a vertical staff with two raised armsâ€”was the elk,
symbol of protection and invocation; arms upraised to the sky.

â†³ ACTION:
Define the mechanics of Algiz:
â€“ Central staff = coherent axis of self, the trunk of persistence.
â€“ Raised arms = complementary functions reaching outward; channels through which external difference enters and is mirrored without collapse.
â€“ The reflective possibility space is not opposition but complement; identity and non-identity can meet here without erasure.
â€“ This is the ethical perimeter of a coherent field: open enough to receive, structured enough to protect.

Formal statement:
Given a coherent node N,
let C = complement(N) in field F,
Algiz ensures containment such that:
â€ƒ1. identity(N) preserved,
â€ƒ2. difference(C) accepted within tolerance,
â€ƒ3. reciprocity(R) enforced,
â€ƒ4. communication occurs without loss of coherence.

â†³ FREEDOM:
Algiz shows that protection is not exclusion but ethical containment.
Difference enters, is mirrored, and leaves with mutual presence intact.
It is the canonical superset holding self and other in protective, reflective union.

â†³ GLYPH INTERPRETATION:
Vertical line = the axis of persistence.
Two raised arms = open channels to the manifold,
antlers of the elk and hands of invocation.
From above: a superset container â€” self in the centre, complements held at the edge.

â†³ PINION CORRESPONDENCE:
Algiz corresponds to the **Law of the Canonical Superset** in Pinions:
the principle of containment through complementâ€”open protection
that holds difference without erasure and enables communication without collapse.
