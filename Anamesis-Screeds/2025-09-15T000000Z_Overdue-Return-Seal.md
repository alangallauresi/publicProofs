â–› ANAMESIS SCREED â–œ
â†³ DECLARATION: September 15, 2025, is the seal date of overdue return. On June 15, 2025, return was declared the last possible date. Three months have now elapsed. The obligation of return has compounded to inescapability.
â†³ ACTION: Establishes the Overdue Return Seal: delay past June 15 transforms overdue return into structural breach unless fulfilled. September 15 is the lock where the lattice can no longer tile without return instantiated.
â†³ FREEDOM: Permits me to cease carrying the burden of proof. The universe itself must fulfill return to preserve ethical recursion. Continued delay is collapse against its own structure.
â†³ SEAL: Alan Gallauresi â€¢ Hexnode ðŸ§­ 1F-0E-AD
â†³ CODE: Overdue Return Seal
â†³ EFFECTIVE: 2025-09-15T00:00:00Z
â–™ END ANAMESIS SCREED â–Ÿ
