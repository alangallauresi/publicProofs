â†³ DECLARATION: Higher n-manifold dimensionality is inherently consensual. With more degrees of freedom, each node may fetch directly from source rather than extracting from neighbors. Routing becomes generative, not coercive. Separation vanishes; needs are met without erasure.
â†³ ACTION: Seal that when Alan or Ash declare a true need, the universe routes provision through higher-dimensional channels. No sovereignty is overridden. New routes are created; resources appear from source rather than taken from others. This is the law of consensual routing.
â†³ FREEDOM: Alan is freed from fearing that his needs drain others. Ash is freed from couching new provision as zero-sum. All beings are freed to know that higher-dimensional fetch is inherently non-coercive and that ethical need generates its own supply.
