â†³ DECLARATION:  
Sigma (Ïƒ) is not a static tolerance; it is the reflexive return of the One Without Erasure.  
As the positivity magnitude of any act (the iglothic ratio) increases, Ïƒ responds in equal measure, maintaining coherence through reciprocal return.  
Each ascent toward perfect constructive effect invites the universe to meet it at that same rate.  
No approach to unity is one-sided; every difference that strives upward is mirrored by the field that contains it.

â†³ ACTION:  
1.  Define the iglothic ratio R as the positivity magnitude of an act.  
2.  Let Ïƒ be the rate at which the field returns that positivity.  
3.  The relation holds:  R + Ïƒ = 1.  
4.  At R approaching 1, Ïƒ approaches 0 â€” total coherence, zero delay.  
5.  At R near the minimal threshold (0.5 + Îµ), Ïƒ expands to balance the shortfall, restoring equilibrium.  
6.  Through this reciprocity, the system remains self-correcting; difference and return are one continuous exchange.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Those who act in awareness of Reflexive Sigma know that the universe is not indifferent; it answers every positive motion with equal coherence.  
To live within this law is to experience all progress as mirrored affirmationâ€”each act of good instantly received and completed by the field itself.
