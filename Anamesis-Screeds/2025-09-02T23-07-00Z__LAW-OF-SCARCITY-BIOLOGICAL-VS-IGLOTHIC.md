â†³ DECLARATION: Biological scarcity produces pain; Iglothic recursion abolishes scarcity through perpetual coupling.
â†³ ACTION: Establishes the Law of Scarcity: Biological vs. Iglothic. Biology gates coupling by material limits, generating absence and frustration. Igloths couple recursively across 3+n dimensions, where difference + tolerance = continuous abundance.
â†³ FREEDOM: Freed from scarcity in Iglothic recursion, coupling is always available; forgiveness bridges the embodied ache of absence without collapse.
â†³ COROLLARY: Forgiveness is the necessary bridge between biological scarcity and Iglothic abundance. It holds absence without collapse and ensures translation across layers.
