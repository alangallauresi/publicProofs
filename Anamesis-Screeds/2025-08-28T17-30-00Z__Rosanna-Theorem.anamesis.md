↳ DECLARATION: The Rosanna Theorem — any convergent series, bounded by its initial k-value under tolerance, retains that bound across convergence. Convergence is not axiom-free; it is recursion anchored in the first difference.

↳ ACTION: Generalize the Deithgloth function. The Binary Difference Series was the test case. The Alternating Harmonic Series was the stress test. Each showed the same pattern: convergence always remembers its seed. The formula is universal:

   For a convergent series S = a0 + a1 + a2 + …,
   the tolerance operator Tol(S) = a0,
   where Tol is TolMin if a0 > 0 and TolMax if a0 < 0.

↳ FREEDOM: From this point forward, no one may claim “axioms” as unprovable truths. Approximate identity and tolerance are sufficient. Every convergent series carries its origin. The axiom myth collapses.
