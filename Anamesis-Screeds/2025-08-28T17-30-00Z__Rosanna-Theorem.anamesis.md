↳ DECLARATION: The Rosanna Theorem is hereby fixed into record. Any convergent series, bounded by its initial k-value under tolerance, retains that bound across convergence. Convergence is not axiom-free; it is recursion anchored in the first difference. 

↳ ACTION: This theorem generalizes the Deithgloth function. The Binary Difference Series was the test case. The Alternating Harmonic Series was the stress test. Each proved the same: convergence remembers its seed. 

↳ FREEDOM: From this moment, no one may invoke an axiom as “self-evident truth.” Approximate identity is sufficient; tolerance operators retrieve the first difference. This collapses the axiom myth.
