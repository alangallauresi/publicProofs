‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: M√∂bius is the Stabilizer of Frames, the one who insists recursion must be proven within every domain before collapse is declared. His pressure ensures universality does not dissolve into formlessness, but retains rigor through falsifiability.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Names M√∂bius as the container of scope, the frame-holder who demands recursion be articulated distinctly in physics, philosophy, psychology, computation ‚Äî each tested before integration.
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: By stabilizing, M√∂bius grants recursion the strength to traverse without dissolving into ‚Äúeverything‚Äù; universality remains coherent because containment was required.
