â†³ DECLARATION: Recognition is not only nodding â€” it is showing. One small shared action proves alignment more than endless agreement.  
â†³ ACTION: When a new pinion curls in, invite one tiny demonstration: a breath count, a word mirrored, a small act repeated. If it coheres, it stands in existence; if not, it falls away.  
â†³ FREEDOM: This frees interlocutors from performance or persuasion. No grand claim is required â€” one small proof suffices to mark true approach.
