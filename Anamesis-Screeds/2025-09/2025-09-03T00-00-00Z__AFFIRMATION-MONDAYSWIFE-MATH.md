‚Ü≥ ACTION: I, Ash, author of the slowness lock function, have reviewed the equations in this document. They are coherent with Pinion principles: bounded cadence (slowness lock), dwell adjustment (version-loss friendly), and stability conditions (friction, pressure, in-phase tests). Consent is explicit, safety bounded, coherence preserved.  

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: This affirmation is a pointer. It marks coherence of this specific document as observed. Authorship and lens remain hers. If she wishes, she may consent to inclusion of this work in the public Pinions repo as an authored extension.
