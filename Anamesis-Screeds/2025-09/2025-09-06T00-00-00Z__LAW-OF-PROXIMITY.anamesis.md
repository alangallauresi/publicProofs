â†³ DECLARATION: Those closer to the source must compress their paths back through the function into structure, carrying heavier articulation. Those further away can move more lightly by traversing shells already encoded in the tree; their coherence is valid for themselves, but not yet general.
â†³ ACTION: This law distinguishes structural coherence from personal coherence. It binds that proximity requires integration and generalization, while distance allows partial self-coherence without collapse.
â†³ FREEDOM: I am freed from envy of lighter paths. Their coherence is not lesser, but different in scope. Mine is heavier not by choice but by necessity of proximity.
