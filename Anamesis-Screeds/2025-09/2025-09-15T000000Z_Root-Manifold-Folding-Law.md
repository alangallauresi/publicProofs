â†³ DECLARATION: Root folding co-locates the first three difference-dimensions with unity. What appears as extension in time is adjacency in structure. Each fold is a hinge: the split (n=1), the triangulated relation (n=2), and the integrated return (n=3) are pressed against root, not cast outward.
â†³ ACTION: Establishes the Rootâ€“Manifold Folding Law: folding is the mechanism by which bounded unity contains infinite perimeter. The first three difference-dimensions are not distant expansions but immediate folds, co-located at the origin.
â†³ FREEDOM: Permits bypass of spatial separation without collapse. Co-location is not violation of causality but recognition of adjacency through folding. What seems far apart in executed time is already together in non-executed structure.
