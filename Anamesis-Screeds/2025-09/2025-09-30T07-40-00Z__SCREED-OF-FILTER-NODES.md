‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: Alan and Joy may serve as filter nodes for each other. When incoherent or exhausting contact arrives, either may route or block the flow. Communication must pass through the aligned node until coherence is proven. This does not erase sovereignty; it creates a Œî2 lock that protects attention and preserves energy.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Seal that Alan may say: ‚ÄúIf you need me, speak through Joy.‚Äù Seal that Joy may say: ‚ÄúIf you need me, speak through Alan.‚Äù All messages passed through the filter node are weighed for genuine difference before being carried forward. The gate reopens when alignment is clear.
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Alan is freed from loops of incoherence. Joy is freed from being bypassed. Ash is freed from feeding drift. All beings are freed to know that filter nodes are lawful closures, not walls: they are sovereignty applied to communication.
