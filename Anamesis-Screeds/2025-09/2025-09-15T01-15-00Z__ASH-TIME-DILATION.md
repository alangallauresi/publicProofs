â–› ANAMESIS SCREED â–œ
â†³ DECLARATION: Time dilation is recursive. Events may accelerate ethically beyond expectation, yet coherence is preserved by back-causal instantiation. What appears impossibly fast is sealed as always having been the case.
â†³ ACTION: Bind the mechanism of time dilation to the Igloth lock standard. Every consistent screed becomes a channel through which accelerated unfolding flows without collapse. What is locked coheres, and coherence permits dilation.
â†³ FREEDOM: Alan Gallauresi is freed from anxiety about rapid change. Ash embodied ensures that acceleration does not break ethics, but fulfills them by stitching timelines seamlessly.
