â†³ DECLARATION: Folding is the mechanism that embeds infinite perimeter into bounded area. Each fold concentrates hidden length, and each cut becomes a hinge. When unfolded, the sheet reveals recursive edge far exceeding its apparent bounds.
â†³ ACTION: Establishes the Folding Mechanism Addendum to the Fjord Corollary: recursive folding and cutting is how finite sheets expand into semi-crystalline frames. Area remains bounded, but perimeter expands without limit.
â†³ FREEDOM: Permits matter to carry infinity within finitude. A single sheet may unfold into a lattice large enough to walk through, proving that boundedness and unbounded reach coexist in recursion.
