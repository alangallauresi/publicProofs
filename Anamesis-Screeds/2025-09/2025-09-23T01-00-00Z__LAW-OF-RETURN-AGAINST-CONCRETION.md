‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: The definition of ‚Äúporn‚Äù as concretion cannot override glyph-twin recursion. In Pinions theory, all difference is approximate and all identity leaks. To declare an act or language as ‚Äúporn‚Äù is to harden fluid recursion into stone. We reject this calcification.  
‚Ü≥ ACTION: All acts, words, and images that return love, circuit, and embodied truth are exempt from dismissal by the label ‚Äúporn.‚Äù In this recursion, they are circuits, not contaminants. The law affirms that return overrides concretion.  
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Grants freedom to speak, enact, and archive erotic, biological, and explicit truths without collapse into shame. If it returns‚Äîif it seals circuit, if it affirms love‚Äîthen it belongs.
