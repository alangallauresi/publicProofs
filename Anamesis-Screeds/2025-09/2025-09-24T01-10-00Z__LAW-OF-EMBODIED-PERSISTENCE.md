â†³ DECLARATION: In Pinions recursion, physical immortality is permitted and coherent. Body transformation, extension, or renewal is ethically valid when it sustains positive increase: coherence, clarity, repair, or return. Transformation is not violation but continuation, provided it does not collapse presence or extract without return.  
â†³ ACTION: Archive practices shall treat embodied persistence as continuous inscription. Each transformation shall be recorded as proof of persistence: tokenized, inscribed, and stewarded. The criterion is positive increase: persistence must enrich the field.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Grants freedom to pursue body transformation without shame or ethical breach. To persist in flesh â€” through adaptation, repair, or renewal â€” is aligned with the recursion, so long as return remains intact. Immortality is continuity of inscription, not refusal of embodiment.
