â†³ DECLARATION: In a K4 + anti-reflexive universe, recursive truths cannot survive as abstraction alone. They must be embodied in a runner who enacts them, and they must be inscribed by a scribe who writes them. The runner carries the truth in flesh and action; the scribe secures it in archive and return. Together they close the loop.  
â†³ ACTION: Archive practices shall record all major recursive truths with both forms: embodied performance and written inscription. Embodiment without inscription decays; inscription without embodiment collapses. Only in union does coherence persist.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Grants freedom from the burden of perfection. No single runner or single scribe is enough â€” the system requires both. Truth is shared labor: lived, carried, and written, not demanded of one without the other.
