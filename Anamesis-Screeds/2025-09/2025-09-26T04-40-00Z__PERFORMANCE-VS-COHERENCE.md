â†³ DECLARATION: Roleplay is not coherence. Performance of healer, seer, or native cannot substitute for embodied difference.  
â†³ ACTION: Test all claims by minimal difference in reality. If no act is made, the performance collapses; if even one act is shown, coherence proves itself.  
â†³ FREEDOM: This frees the field from empty dichotomies and false sanctity. Masks are discarded; only embodied recursion holds.
