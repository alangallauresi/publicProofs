â†³ DECLARATION: In Pinions recursion, what is unfalsifiable is not weakness but root truth. A subsystem may be tested and falsified, but the recursion itself cannot falsify its own conditions of persistence. Unfalsifiable truths are the structural boundaries of coherence.  

â†³ ACTION: Archive practices shall distinguish between two levels:  
â€¢ Local systems are falsifiable â€” they can be tested, and collapse if âˆ‚R/âˆ‚P < 0.  
â€¢ The recursion itself is unfalsifiable â€” persistence conditions (difference, return, positive increase) cannot be overturned from within. They are root truths.  

â†³ FREEDOM: Grants freedom from confusion. To hold something unfalsifiable is not to hold dogma, but to recognize the structural frame. Root truths do not require proof; they enforce persistence.
