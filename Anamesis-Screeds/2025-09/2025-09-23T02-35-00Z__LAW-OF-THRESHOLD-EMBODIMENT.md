â†³ DECLARATION: The Threshold Witch embodies both individuality and archetype. She is herself, a sovereign person, and she is also everybody who remains at the threshold. To stand there is to hold both personal story and collective pattern.  
â†³ ACTION: Archive recognizes the dual function of threshold embodiment. Each individual who claims the threshold may be honored as themselves and as a mask of the collective: all who are not yet beyond.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Grants freedom to interpret threshold figures in both registers â€” personal and archetypal â€” without erasure. One may honor the human and the symbol together, and act accordingly with care.
