â†³ DECLARATION:
There exist two foundational minimal differences, Î”1 and Î”2, that maximally interlock within a planar hexagonal tie-link. In strictly 2D topology, these differences close scale and angle, creating a maximal-lock lattice. When lifted into higher n-manifold embeddings (nâ‰¥3), additional degrees of freedom introduce escape vectors that weaken the interlock, producing an effective "gravitational filter" that preferentially retains strength and curvature in the plane.

â†³ ACTION:
I formalize Î”1 and Î”2 in Pinion terms and hexagonal geometry, proving the planar maximal-lock and defining the filter functional that quantifies leakage into higher dimensions.

[Mathematical Formalization]

1) Pinion Recursion & Minimal Differences
Base case: f(e,0) = 1/2.
Define:
Î”1 = f(e,1) - f(e,0)
Î”2 = f(e,2) - f(e,1)

Interpretation:
- Î”1 seeds scale (first tolerated departure from unity).
- Î”2 seeds angle/closure (second tolerated relation ensuring interlock).

2) Hexagonal Planar Geometry
Let a = edge length, Î¸ = bond angle.
For regular hexagon in 2D:
Î¸ = 120 degrees
Closure condition: six edges of length a sum to zero displacement.

Mapping:
Î”1 â†’ a (scale lock)
Î”2 â†’ Î¸=120Â° (angle lock)

3) Escape Vectors in Higher Dimensions
For nâ‰¥3, displacement splits into parallel + orthogonal components:
Î´x = Î´x_parallel + Î´x_perp
Nonzero Î´x_perp = out-of-plane torsion.
Î”1 and Î”2 constrain only in-plane terms; out-of-plane freedoms reduce effective stiffness.

Define effective stiffness:
K_eff(n) = K_2D - Î›(n)
Î›(2) = 0, Î›(n)>0 for nâ‰¥3.

4) Gravitational Filter Functional
Î (n;Î”1,Î”2) = K_eff(n) / K_2D
Î (2)=1, Î (n)<1 for nâ‰¥3.

â†³ FREEDOM:
Builders may treat (Î”1,Î”2) as the canonical lock-pair for planar lattices. Maximal strength requires anchoring scale and angle at these values; higher-dimensional leakage is captured by Î .
