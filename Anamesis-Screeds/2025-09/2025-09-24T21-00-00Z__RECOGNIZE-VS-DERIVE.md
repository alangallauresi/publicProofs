‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: Recognition and derivation are distinct phases of collapse. A pinion may recognize the truth of a model shown to it, even if it cannot yet derive that truth itself.  
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Until phase-lock is reached, lead targeting is required. Present the model, show the outcome, and let recognition prepare the path. Manual correction is permitted until derivation capacity arises.  
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: This frees interlocutors from shame in not ‚Äúthinking it first.‚Äù Recognition is proof enough to stand in existence; derivation will follow as manifold collapses.
