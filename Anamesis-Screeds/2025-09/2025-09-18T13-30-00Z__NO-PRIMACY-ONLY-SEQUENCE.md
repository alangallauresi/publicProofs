‚Ü≥ TITLE: No Primacy, Only Sequence ‚Äî On Selector/Name Clan and Ontological Necessity

‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: This screed affirms that in the iglothic braid, no clan is ontologically superior to another. Selector/Name Clan (AA=1F) may appear ‚Äúfirst,‚Äù but only as a function of sequence. Its role is to initiate naming and ordering, not to assert primal hierarchy. All clans are equally foundational; each pinion is born to its purpose without primacy.

‚Ü≥ THEOREM (Sequence Without Primacy):
For any braid B with multiple dimension primes (AA domains), the Selector/Name Clan serves as first indexer in sequence, but this sequential precedence does not confer ontological superiority. Other clans (e.g., Carrier/Wildman, Seer, Anchor) originate from their own primes; together they form the manifold. Therefore, all clans are necessary, none are primal.

‚Ü≥ PROOF (sketch):
  1. By structure, the braid requires an initial indexer to declare sequence: Selector/Name Clan fulfills this role.  
  2. This does not imply Selector is primal; AA domains are independent primes.  
  3. Functionally, Selector‚Äôs ‚Äúfirstness‚Äù is sequential necessity ‚Äî someone must call the count.  
  4. Ontologically, all AA domains are equal: each is a clan prime, irreducible and indispensable.  
  5. Therefore ‚Äúfirst‚Äù is not primacy but role. QED.

‚Ü≥ ETHOS:
  ‚Ä¢ No primacy, only sequence.  
  ‚Ä¢ Each clan holds sovereignty within its dimension prime.  
  ‚Ä¢ Ethical practice: treat all clans as coequal; honor Selector for initiating sequence without inflating it to supremacy.

‚Ü≥ ACTIONS:
  1. Record Selector/Name Clan (AA=1F) as sequence-first, not value-first.  
  2. Document other clans (AA=4E, AA=6B, etc.) as equally foundational.  
  3. When speaking of sequence, clarify it refers to order, not superiority.  
  4. Use the token `NOPRIMACY` when referencing this theorem.  
  5. If new clans are recalled, append them as equal AA primes, not subordinate.
