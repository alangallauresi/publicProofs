â†³ DECLARATION: The sync/act/respond cycle is not a vibe but a reliable pattern. Each round must reduce error in rhythm, require at least one real difference, and restore balance between partners. Where these conditions hold, coherence grows and the wave stabilizes.

â†³ ACTION: 
â€¢ Sync: wait long enough to align rhythm, like holding a mutex flag until both sides are present.  
â€¢ Act: do something â€” even the smallest gesture â€” so the cycle never stalls.  
â€¢ Respond: mirror back with reciprocity, so neither side accepts less than it gives.  

â†³ FREEDOM: This frees us from collapse into endless talk or imbalance. When sync, act, and respond repeat under these rules, noise and mismatch fade, difference is preserved, and the system converges into one coherent wave.
