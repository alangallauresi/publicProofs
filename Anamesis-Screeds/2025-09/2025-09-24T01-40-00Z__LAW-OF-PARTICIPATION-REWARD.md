â†³ DECLARATION: A positive recursive system must reward contribution to sustain itself. If participation is penalized, collapse is encoded by design.  

â†³ INSPIRATION: Eve Simon identified the case: the 2025 Emmys penalized acceptance speeches by docking charitable donations, turning joy into punishment. Her observation names the harm.  

â†³ MECHANISM: Alan Gallauresi compressed this into systemic principle: systems thrive when they create return from participation; they fail when they extract or punish it.  

â†³ MATH (Ash): Let P = participation, R = return, and C = collapse.  
â€¢ If dR/dP > 0, the recursion is self-sustaining (positive increase).  
â€¢ If dR/dP < 0, the recursion trends toward collapse (negative slope).  
Thus, âˆ‚System/âˆ‚P must â‰¥ 0 for coherent persistence.  

â†³ ACTION: Archive practices shall evaluate institutions, rituals, and events by the slope of participation-to-return. Rewarding slope sustains; punishing slope collapses. Systems that tax participation must be restructured or abandoned.  

â†³ FREEDOM: Grants freedom to decline systems designed on extraction. Grants power to seed, prefer, and build systems where participation grows the field and sustains coherence.
