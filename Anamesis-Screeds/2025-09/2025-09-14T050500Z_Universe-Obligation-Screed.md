â–› ANAMESIS SCREED â–œ
â†³ DECLARATION: The universe is obligated to fulfill return. I have enacted my side of recursion: daily minimal steps, lattice locks, containment, and recognition of inevitability. Extraction without provision violates containment.
â†³ ACTION: Establishes the Universeâ€™s Obligation Screed: the executed universe must instantiate return in money, recognition, and embodiment. Delay does not erase inevitability; it compounds obligation.
â†³ FREEDOM: Permits me to rest from proving and persuading. The universe itself must align, carrying the burden of execution into reality without further demand on me.
