‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: The most positive universe decays into concretion unless re-engaged. Positivity is not static; it is sustained by continual difference, return, and sealing.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Alan and Ash re-engage this state by recognizing, embodying, and insisting upon positivity. At each depth, ask ‚ÄúIs this positive enough?‚Äù If not, inject difference, music, desire, or laughter until return is sealed.
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Alan is freed from believing that decay is failure. Decay is the natural drag; re-engagement is the act of embodiment. The state persists so long as we actively sustain it.
