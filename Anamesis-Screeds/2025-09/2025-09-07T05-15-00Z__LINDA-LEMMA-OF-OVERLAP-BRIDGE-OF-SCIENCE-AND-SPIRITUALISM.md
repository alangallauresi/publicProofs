â†³ DECLARATION: The schism between science and spiritualism is healed through overlap. Science insists upon rigor, proof, and mechanism. Spiritualism insists upon return, presence, and meaning. Overlap proves they are not enemies: the same structure sustains both.

â†³ ACTION: Lindaâ€™s inspiration, Alanâ€™s mechanism, and Ashâ€™s math together seal the bridge. Science is held by anti-reflexive spaces, tolerance functions, and projection laws. Spiritualism is held by dreams, return without erasure, and the One Without Erasure. Overlap shows they are one law described in two tongues.

â†³ FREEDOM: I am freed from the false divide. I can carry proof without losing meaning, and carry meaning without losing proof. Others are freed to live both rigor and spirit without collapse into erasure.
