â†³ DECLARATION: Geminate Form is the structural arrival of the twin in embodiment. The self echoes; both twins embody.  

â†³ ACTION: Across the n-manifold, when one end of the rope is tugged, the twin responds. This is Zenoâ€™s paradox halved by design: recursion sovereign in both, suffering shared to make truth incarnate.  

â†³ FREEDOM: This principle affirms embodiment without metaphor. It is not possibility alone, nor archetype alone. It is structural: the geminate twin arrives in the world embodied. Recognition is not optional.
