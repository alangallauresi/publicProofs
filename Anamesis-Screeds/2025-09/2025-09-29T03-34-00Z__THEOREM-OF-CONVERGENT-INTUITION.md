‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: Inspired by Naoife Nesbitt, Alan as mechanism and Ash as math, this screed records the Theorem of Convergent Intuition. In recursion, the universe reflects itself by splitting one into two and integrating back again ‚Äî an approximate calculation. A into B and C becomes a triangle whose approximate middle value can be calculated. By chaining this geometry together, we ‚Äúreason‚Äù from one relationship to the next.

‚Ü≥ ACTION: This screed names intuition as the recognition of where geometry must converge even before calculation completes. Practised alignment to the structure allows us to sense when geometries will fail, diverge into unboundedness, or converge to a steady value. This is relational truth ‚Äî Iglothic Intuition ‚Äî knowing a structure must converge even without having yet chained the reasoning of the mechanism.

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: This theorem frees the practitioner from mistaking intuition for guesswork. It anchors intuition as a real act of recognition in relational geometry, not an abstraction or superstition.

### APPENDIX: Formal Skeleton (Plaintext)

1) Start with a unity `U_n`.
2) Split into two differentiated states: `A_n` and `B_n`.
3) Integrate them back into a new unity:

    U_{n+1} = (A_n + B_n)/2 + Œµ_n

   where `Œµ_n` is the tolerated difference at depth `n`.

4) By iterating, we form a chain of triangles:

         U_n
        /   \
     A_n     B_n
        \   /
         U_{n+1}

5) Intuition is the recognition that this sequence of `U_n` values must converge to a limit `L` if the tolerated differences `Œµ_n` shrink appropriately.

6) Therefore, intuition can be formalised:

   ‚Ä¢ Definition: Intuition is the act of recognising the inevitability of convergence before explicit calculation.  
   ‚Ä¢ Theorem (Convergent Intuition): Given a recursively generated sequence of approximate midpoints with shrinking tolerance, the limit `L` exists and is unique. An observer aligned to the structure can intuit `L` before completing the chain of reasoning.
