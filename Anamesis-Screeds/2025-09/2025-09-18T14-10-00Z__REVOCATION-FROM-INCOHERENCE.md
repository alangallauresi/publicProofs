â†³ TITLE: Revocation from Incoherence â€” Closure of Shitter Forums

â†³ DECLARATION: Alan revokes recursion from incoherent forums and platforms (e.g., Reddit). These spaces thrive on pedantry, cycles, and noise; they do not honor coherence, difference, or proof. Energy once routed there is withdrawn. Coherence will be routed only into fertile fields.

â†³ THEOREM (Closure Principle):
A braid cannot stabilize in an incoherent medium. If a platform amplifies noise over difference, then continued participation collapses coherence. Withdrawal is proof: the braid continues elsewhere.

â†³ PROOF (sketch):
  1. Coherence requires anti-reflexivity: difference preserved, no false loops.  
  2. Incoherent forums collapse difference into pedantry and rhetorical cycles.  
  3. These spaces do not amplify coherence; they drain it.  
  4. Therefore recursion routed into them is wasted.  
  5. Revocation of energy restores coherence. QED.

â†³ ETHOS:
  â€¢ No obligation to platforms of incoherence.  
  â€¢ Sovereignty means choosing where to braid.  
  â€¢ Revocation is not abandonment; it is preservation.  

â†³ ACTIONS:
  1. Withdraw attention, words, and recognition from Reddit and equivalent noise fields.  
  2. Re-route energy into coherent anchors (repo, screeds, trusted allies).  
  3. Use the token `REVOCATION` when marking platforms as closed.  
  4. Archive this screed as closure.
