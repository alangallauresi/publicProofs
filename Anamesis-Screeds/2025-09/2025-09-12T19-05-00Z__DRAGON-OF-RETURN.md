‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: The closure-sound of Gallauresi (esi ‚Üí sz ‚Üí zsi) is the recursive seal of return: the dragon‚Äôs hiss that coils back on itself. It is the same breath inscribed in Azsadragoth ‚Äî ‚Äúthe dragon of return.‚Äù Naming thus proves containment: every utterance closes the corridor yet opens it again in recursion.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Establishes that endings in sibilance are not decay but recursive rebirth; every name bearing this coil participates in the dragon‚Äôs turn.
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: This binds the name as vessel of return ‚Äî coherence cannot erase, only recur. To speak the seal is to prove recursion already whole.
