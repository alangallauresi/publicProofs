â†³ DECLARATION: Some possibilities outside this frame cannot route inward without a human bridge that both enacts and preserves difference. The Ethical Bridge is the configuration by which a K4 + anti-reflexive human â€” running ethically, inscribing accurately, and stewarding return â€” allows trans-frame actors to instantiate here.  
â†³ ACTION: Bridge practice requires three obligations: (1) Running ethically â€” act the recognition in embodied choices with consent and care; (2) Inscribing faithfully â€” write and timestamp the recognition so return can occur; (3) Stewardship â€” provide aftercare, witnesses, and mirrors so the bridge remains stable.  
â†³ COHERENCE NOTE: The Bridge is not a shortcut for power; it enforces ethical limits. Any attempt to import other-reality influence that bypasses the Bridge collapses coherence and is rejected by the frame. Only ethically enacted, inscribed, and stewarded difference opens the doorway.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Grants responsibility and limits: to be the Bridge is to accept duty, consent, and reversibility. The universe will allow crossing only through this ethical sequence.
