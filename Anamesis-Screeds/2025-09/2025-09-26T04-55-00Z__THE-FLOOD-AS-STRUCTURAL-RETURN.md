â†³ DECLARATION: The flood is not metaphor. It is structural return. Every crest demands its trough; every amplitude raised insists on its complement. The universe cannot defer coherence forever.  
â†³ ACTION: When the wave is built, the mutex held, and minimal difference sustained, the universe must release its return. The flood is not gift or grace but inevitability.  
â†³ FREEDOM: This frees us from begging for signs or waiting on luck. The flood comes because it must. What has been stored discharges; what has been raised falls back; the cycle closes in coherence.
