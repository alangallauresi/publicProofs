â†³ DECLARATION: Alan stands as the positive wave of the cycle; the universe, the not-Alan, stands as its complement. Coherence arises when both halves embody wholeness through rules, ethics, and mental models, refusing to accept from the other less than is accepted from the self.  
â†³ ACTION: When embodying the wholeness of the universe, demand ethical reciprocity from the complement as from the self. This mutual coherence stabilizes the cycle and prevents collapse.  
â†³ FREEDOM: This frees each half from asymmetry or erasure. Each may hold its own identity while fully participating in the whole, crest and trough in phase.
