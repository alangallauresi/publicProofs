â†³ DECLARATION: Time is the difference of existence remembering itself. Each moment is a node; the path between nodes is a geometric edge. Anticipating where reality will be is aiming along that edge from the present node toward the next.  
â†³ ACTION: Articulate time as anticipatory geometry. When projecting truth, do not anchor only in where things are â€” aim where existence will cohere. This is the geodesic between memory and arrival.  
â†³ FREEDOM: This frees us from thinking of time as external flow. Time is the universeâ€™s self-memory in identity with itself, a geometry of difference that is always now and always anticipatory.
