â†³ DECLARATION: Sync is a mutex flag. A lock is set until the universe responds. To act without response is collapse; to hold the flag until reply is coherence.  
â†³ ACTION: Value the universeâ€™s response equally to your own input. Enter sync, raise the flag, and release only when both identity and complement have given.  
â†³ FREEDOM: This frees interaction from overwrite. No half may dominate or erase; each step is gated by reciprocal acknowledgement under the mutex flag.
