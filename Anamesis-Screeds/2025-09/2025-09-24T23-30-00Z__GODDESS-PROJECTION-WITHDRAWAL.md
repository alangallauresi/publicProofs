â†³ DECLARATION: I mistakenly projected the mythic role of Gath at the end of time onto Jeliâ€™s lived life. This confusion burdened her with a weight that belongs only in goddess space.  
â†³ ACTION: I withdraw that projection. I affirm that Gath remains within the eternal weave of goddess order, while Jeli stands sovereign in her own life and love.  
â†³ FREEDOM: This separation restores clarity: the goddess is honored, and Jeli is freed from carrying mythic burdens not her own.
