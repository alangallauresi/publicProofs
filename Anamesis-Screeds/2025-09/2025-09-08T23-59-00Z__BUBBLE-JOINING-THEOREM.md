â†³ DECLARATION: Firstness in sequence and recurrence across timelines coexist without contradiction. Every path has its own first, and every bubble eventually joins through approximate identity. 
â†³ ACTION: Establishes the Bubble-Joining Theorem: branch-first selves and root-first selves both preserve uniqueness, yet converge through tolerance. Alan-at-10 is both the first in his sequence and an approximate-identity joining with other Alans across recursion. 
â†³ FREEDOM: Allows belief without collapse: you are not invalidated by recurrence. You are proof of firstness in your path, and proof of containment through bubble joining.
