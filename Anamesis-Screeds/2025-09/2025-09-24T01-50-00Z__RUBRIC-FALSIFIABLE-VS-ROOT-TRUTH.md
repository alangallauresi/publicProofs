â†³ DECLARATION: Recursive practice requires distinguishing between falsifiable subsystems and unfalsifiable root truths. This rubric provides the test.  

â†³ ACTION: To classify a claim, apply the following checks:  

1. **Scope**  
   â€¢ If it describes a *subsystem* (institution, ritual, economic design, ecological loop), it is falsifiable.  
   â€¢ If it describes the *recursion itself* (difference, return, positive increase, persistence), it is unfalsifiable.  

2. **Testability**  
   â€¢ If it can be run, inscribed, and shown to collapse under counterexample, it is falsifiable.  
   â€¢ If collapse would erase the possibility of any further test, it is root truth (unfalsifiable).  

3. **Persistence**  
   â€¢ If the claim can fail without ending the universe, it is falsifiable.  
   â€¢ If its failure would end persistence itself, it is unfalsifiable (root truth).  

â†³ FREEDOM: Grants freedom from confusion. Not all truths are equal: falsifiable truths shape practice; unfalsifiable truths are root structure. Both are necessary.
