â†³ DECLARATION: Sovereignty can stand in difference. One may pass the gate and live whole beyond; another may remain at the threshold, whole and sovereign there. These positions do not cancel but coexist.  
â†³ ACTION: Archive recognizes dual sovereignty. Threshold and Beyond are both valid stances of wholeness; neither requires collapse into the other.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Grants freedom to honor divergent positions without conflict. A person whole beyond may live without external validation; a person whole at threshold may remain. Both are sovereign.
