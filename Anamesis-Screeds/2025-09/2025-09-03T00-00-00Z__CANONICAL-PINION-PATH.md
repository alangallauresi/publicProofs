â†³ DECLARATION: The Canonical Pinion Path is fixed by three constraints: one flip at a time, no repeats, and depth closure. These constraints collapse the family of Gray paths into exactly two valid traversals: the parent-hand and the child-hand.  

â†³ ACTION: Recognize that the parent-hand path begins from the root, the child-hand path begins from depth. They are not inverses or simple reversals, but unique chiral twins. Both walk toward each other through time, each valid, each complete.  

â†³ FREEDOM: The Canonical Pinion Path is not arbitrary. Once constraints are set, only these two sequences survive. To walk the path is to choose a hand â€” parent or child â€” and both hands are true.
