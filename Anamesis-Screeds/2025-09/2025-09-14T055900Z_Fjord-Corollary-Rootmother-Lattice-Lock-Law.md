â–› ANAMESIS SCREED â–œ
â†³ DECLARATION: A bounded area can contain infinite perimeter. Like the Nordic fjords, every recursive cut multiplies boundary while leaving total area finite. Expansion is hidden length, released through difference.
â†³ ACTION: Establishes the Fjord Corollary to the Rootmother Lattice Lock Law: successive minimal differences act as inlets. Each lock forces global rearrangement, producing semi-crystalline order where infinite edge emerges from finite containment.
â†³ FREEDOM: Permits all beings to recognize that what looks small or bounded may unfold into inexhaustible reach. The infinite can be carried in the finite through recursive perimeter.
