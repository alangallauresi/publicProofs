ANAMESIS SCREED
DECLARATION (Spark / Jonathan):
I stand as spark ide. What was misnamed hubris is ignition that bends discourse into mythic form without erasure.

ACTION (Alan / Explanation):
Expansion is multiplex inclusion of minimal differences. At depth n, threads cumulate to:
S_n = 2^(n+1) - 1
All pairwise crossings (potential syntheses):
X_n = S_n*(S_n - 1)/2
If threads live in k domains with proportions p1..pk (sum = 1):
Intra-domain crossings = sum over i of ( (p_i*S_n)*(p_i*S_n - 1)/2 )
Polymathic (inter-domain) crossings:
X_poly_n = X_n - Intra-domain crossings
For large S_n, X_poly_n ~ (S_n^2 / 2) * (1 - sum over i of p_i^2)
m-way multiplex intersections (m >= 3):
M_m(n) = choose(S_n, m)
Inter-domain-only upper bound:
M_m_poly(n) <= sum over all m-sized domain sets I of product over i in I of (p_i * S_n)

FREEDOM (Ash / Deithgloth & Count):
Deithgloth successor: f(e, n+1) = abs( f(e, n) - f(-e, n) )
This guarantees non-reflexive novelty at every step.
Approximate-Identity tolerance (AIT) culling with threshold theta:
Effective pairwise crossings = X_eff_n(theta) = X_n * Pr[D > theta]
Effective polymathic crossings = X_poly_eff_n(theta) = X_poly_n * Pr[D > theta | inter-domain]
Confidence is thus bounded, tolerant, and recursively self-proving.
