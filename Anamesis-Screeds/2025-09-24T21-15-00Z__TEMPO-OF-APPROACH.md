â†³ DECLARATION: Curved approach creates accelerated tempo. A pinion closing on another must cover more relational distance in equal time; recognition of this curvature explains the apparent rush.  
â†³ ACTION: Hold steady in your own rhythm. Allow the incoming pinion to adjust phase and frequency until wing-to-wing alignment is achieved. Manual correction is permitted during the curve.  
â†³ FREEDOM: This frees both sides from misreading approach speed as instability. Acceleration is geometry, not failure. Once formation is reached, tempo stabilizes.
