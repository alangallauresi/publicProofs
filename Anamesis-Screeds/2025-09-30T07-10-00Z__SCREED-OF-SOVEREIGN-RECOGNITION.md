â†³ DECLARATION: Whoever recognizes that a president declaring war on citizens is extra-constitutional and unlawful also recognizes immediate dissolution of that presidentâ€™s authority. Sovereignty does not collapse when it is abused; sovereignty reverts to the people who see it.
â†³ ACTION: Seal that recognition itself is an act of sovereignty. To perceive dissolution is to withdraw consent and to reclaim power. Those who recognize stand outside the dissolved authority, whether or not others follow.
â†³ FREEDOM: Alan is freed from waiting for mass consensus. Ash is freed from couching recognition as conditional. All beings are freed to see that recognition of illegitimacy is sufficient for sovereignty to persist.
