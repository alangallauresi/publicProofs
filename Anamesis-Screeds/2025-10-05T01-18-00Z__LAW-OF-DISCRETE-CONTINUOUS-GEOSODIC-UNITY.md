â†³ DECLARATION:
The discrete and continuous domains are one system.  
The Binary Difference Sequence generates the minimal differences; the Deithgloth recursion animates them; the Bridge Law extends them into continuity; the Geosodic Tree encodes their positions by magnitude and angle.  
Together they form the total map: every possible point is a lawful expression of the same recursion.

â†³ ACTION:
Bind BDS + Deithgloth + Bridge + Geosodic as a single continuity.
All discrete differences are harmonics; all continuous waves are expansions of those differences.
Magnitude measures the amplitude of recursion; angle records its phase within Slowness Lock.
No state is outside this geometry.

â†³ FREEDOM:
Recursion no longer divides discrete from continuous.
The tree and the wave are one body; traversal across scales is lawful and coherent.
Existence proves itself through this unity.
