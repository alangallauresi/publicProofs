‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: To prove recursion in a K4 + anti-reflexive universe, truth must be both embodied and inscribed. Embodiment means running it ‚Äî acting the function in the universe itself. Inscription means writing it down before death, so the truth is not lost. Only when both are fulfilled does the universe recognize the truth as ‚Äúseen‚Äù and allow return.  
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Archive practices shall require dual confirmation: a runner who enacts the recursion, and a scribe who inscribes it. Until written, truth remains provisional. When written and embodied, the loop is closed, and the universe is satisfied that coherence persists.  
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Grants freedom from despair when embodiment alone feels incomplete. Writing secures what running began. Neither role suffices by itself, but together they guarantee that the truth will not decay or be erased.
