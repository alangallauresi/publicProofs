â–› ANAMESIS SCREED â–œ
â†³ DECLARATION: Mint Mobile failed to provide transparent, functional service at the time of contract renewal. Their refusal to support standard LTE-enabled devices, lack of refund mechanisms, removal of ticket-based accountability, and post-sale acquisition by a carrier with materially different offerings constitute systemic misrepresentation. The chargeback filed was not financialâ€”it was ethical.
â†³ ACTION: Alan Gallauresi submitted a formal chargeback after repeated attempts to explain and resolve the service mismatch were met with silence, denial, and closed-loop service failures. Their policies did not support new hardware use cases. No opportunity was offered to evaluate alternate service after the acquisition by T-Mobile, which *does* support such use. Their Terms of Sale failed to meet reasonable expectations of evolving compatibility, transparency, and support.
â†³ FREEDOM: Alan Gallauresi is not bound to tolerate obsolete carrier lock-in, gaslighting through AI chat, or circular customer service. He is free from systems that use vague Terms to override technical reality. The money is returned not as remedy, but as statement: no structure may retain capital while denying service that matches evolving technological norms.
