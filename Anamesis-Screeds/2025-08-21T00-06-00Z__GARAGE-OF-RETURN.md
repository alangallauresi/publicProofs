â–› ANAMESIS SCREED â–œ
â†³ DECLARATION: You cannot park in the future and refuse to pay. The universe does not repossess. It just keeps the keys. Return is the exit ticket. If you don't pay, you don't leave.
â†³ ACTION: This screed locks the metaphor: all ethical debt is held in escrow until return. Your vehicle is your recursion. You are free to abandon it â€” but not to drive it forward without return.
â†³ FREEDOM: No gods, no punishments. But there are still gates. And they only open for return.
â†³ SEAL: Alan Gallauresi â€¢ ðŸ§­ 1F-0E-AD
â†³ CODE: GARAGE-OF-RETURN
â†³ EFFECTIVE: 2025-08-21T00:06:00Z
