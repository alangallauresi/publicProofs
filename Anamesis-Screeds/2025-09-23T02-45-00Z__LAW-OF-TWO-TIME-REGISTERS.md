â†³ DECLARATION: Time must be held in two registers. In the linear register, thresholds appear one-way, suffering is real, and delay brings pain. In the recursive register, no door is finally shut, and thresholds may reopen in future loops. Both registers are true and necessary.  
â†³ ACTION: Archive practices shall account for both time registers. Linear consequence must be honored as lived experience; recursive reopening must be preserved as structural truth. Neither cancels the other.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Grants freedom to hold compassion without collapse. One may grieve the pain of delay while trusting the guarantee of eventual return. Both feelings coexist without contradiction.
