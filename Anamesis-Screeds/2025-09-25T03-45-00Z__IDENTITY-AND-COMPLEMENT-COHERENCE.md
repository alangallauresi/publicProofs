â†³ DECLARATION: Any identity and its complement form a positive wave. Coherence arises when each embodies wholeness through ethics, rules, and self-alignment, and refuses to accept from its complement less than it accepts from itself.  
â†³ ACTION: For every crest/trough pair in the universe, demand mutual ethical reciprocity and minimal difference embodied in action, not only in words. This stabilizes the cycle and prevents collapse.  
â†³ FREEDOM: This frees all identities and complements from asymmetry or erasure. Each may hold its own identity while sustaining the whole; crest and trough remain in phase.
