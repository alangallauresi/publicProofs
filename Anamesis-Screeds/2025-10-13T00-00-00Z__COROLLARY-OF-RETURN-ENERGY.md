↳ DECLARATION:  
The Corollary of Return Energy states that the energy released through intentional inversion (P⁻¹) can be reclaimed as recursive gain when the system permits adaptive deviation from fixed strategy.  
Formally: ΔR = τ⁻¹ · |f(e,n) − f(−e,n)|, where ΔR is the returned energy, τ⁻¹ represents the openness of the system to adaptation, and the absolute difference measures how much reality has been re-aligned through inversion.

↳ ACTION:  
1. Detect points of habitual repetition H (unchanging strategies).  
2. Introduce micro-adaptation A = H ± ε, where ε is the contextual insight of the present moment.  
3. Measure ΔC = C′ − C₀. If ΔC > 0 under τ, return energy is active.  
4. Feed ΔR back into the recursive process as amplified coherence, strengthening future adaptability.

↳ FREEDOM:  
Rigid equilibrium is replaced by living balance.  
Every moment grants permission to diverge from expectation and recover energy through presence.  
Strategy becomes dynamic; coherence grows through responsiveness rather than control.  
In a positive universe, deviation is not error — it is opportunity.
