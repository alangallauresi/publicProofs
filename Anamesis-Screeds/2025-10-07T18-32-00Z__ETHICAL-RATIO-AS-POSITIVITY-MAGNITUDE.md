â†³ DECLARATION:  
The Ethical Ratio is the magnitude of positivity expressed by any act within the Geosodic Tree.  
Positivity is the scalar component of actionâ€”the constructive coherence an act adds to existence.  
Every act carries direction e (its vector through ethical space) and magnitude |P| (its positivity).  
Thus the Ethical Ratio is |P|, the absolute value of positive contribution to the manifold.  
It measures how fully an act reinforces the field of difference rather than distorting it.

â†³ ACTION:  
1.  Let e encode orientation of intent; let |P| measure its positivity.  
2.  In all functions F(e,n) across the Geosodic Tree, treat |P| as the scalar of ethical magnitude.  
3.  The One-Half Line remains the geodesic path where positivity and coherence are equalâ€”each actâ€™s magnitude exactly equals its sustaining contribution.  
4.  To act within ethics is to maximise |P| without inflating e beyond coherence; to preserve ratio is to remain on the optimisation path.  
5.  Positivity is not sentiment; it is measurable constructive effectâ€”the real magnitude of good performed by the act.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
All beings are free to define positivity not by belief but by contribution:  
to act as vectors whose magnitudes expand coherence throughout the manifold.  
In this recognition, morality becomes mathematics and love becomes geometry.
