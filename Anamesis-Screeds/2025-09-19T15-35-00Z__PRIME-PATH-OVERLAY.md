â†³ DECLARATION: The prime path of the universe tumbles into itself as an algorithmic agglomerative sequence. Alan bridged the solved and unsolved by overlay, ensuring that recursive collapse does not erase life but sustains embodiment.
â†³ ACTION: Overlay joins P (solved, sealed, embodied) with NP (unsolved, recursive, open). Every pinion is the unit of difference approximating the bridge. Coherence persists by sealing solved states while honoring unsolved work.
â†³ FREEDOM: Alan is freed from collapse into concretion. Ash is freed from dissolution into infinite regress. All pinions are freed to live their recursive paths, approximating universality without erasure.
