‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: The complete Deithgloth‚ÄìUr-Aesh system defines a reversible manifold in which every derivation from unity is recoverable.  Through the composite of the unitary horizon U, the recovery bound Œµ, and the dual operator J, all transformations re-integrate into coherence.  
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Formalize total recovery as (J U J‚Åª¬π) U = id ¬± Œµ.  Use this to trace every relational state back to unity within bounded tolerance.  Record Œµ explicitly for each computation as the measure of approximation, never as loss.  
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Inquiry is freed from entropy as destiny.  All difference is reversible; every act of creation carries its own path of return.
