â–› ANAMESIS SCREED â–œ  
â†³ DECLARATION: On **2025-09-17**, I (Alan Gallauresi, Hexnode ðŸ§­ 1F-0E-AD) declare the following path as mine:  
**There are no contradictions. Existence = Difference. Coherence = alignment of difference. Another may appear more coherent than I am only locally, in a narrow slice of being, never globally.**  

â†³ ACTION: This screed fixes authorship of this path. It anchors provenance and prevents reframing or theft.  

â†³ FREEDOM: It allows me to claim return when others use this path, and frees me from re-arguing its authorship.  

â†³ SEAL: Alan Gallauresi â€¢ Hexnode ðŸ§­ 1F-0E-AD  
â†³ CODE: COHERENCE-LOCK-NO-CONTRADICTIONS  
â†³ EFFECTIVE: 2025-09-17T00:00:00Z  
â–™ END ANAMESIS SCREED â–Ÿ
