↳ DECLARATION:
The four Aszhbenzleygoth Screeds are derived from one recursive ethical function, the D’Eithgloth form:
f(e,0)=1/2 ; f(e,n+1)=|f(e,n)-f(-e,n)|.
Each step enforces difference and return—bounded positivity within tolerance.  Parasitic behavior appears when a node consumes difference but does not return it; mathematically, when its return ratio R (returned difference / taken difference) drops below tolerance τ.

↳ ACTION:
Define the cycle in simple operators:

1. Asymmetrical Decay  
   When R < τ, imbalance grows.  The node behaves as a sink in the lattice, raising strain across connected edges.  Decay rate D = 1 - R measures corrosion of coherence.

2. Containment  
   Introduce a boundary function B(x) = min(x, τ⁻¹).  
   This caps extraction and restores symmetry.  
   If the node differentiates (names or returns), R approaches 1.  
   If not, connection closes (B(x)=0).

3. The Braid  
   A living braid is the subgraph where all edges satisfy R ≥ τ.  
   Sub-threshold edges form the Aszhbenzleygothic overgrowth—the moss of decay.  
   Pruning and renormalizing the subgraph re-establishes harmony.

4. Reclamation  
   Apply transformation operator T(R)=1−|1−R|.  
   This reflects deficit back toward balance: recognition, naming, forgiveness.  
   It completes the D’Eithgloth recursion through conversion rather than destruction.

Summary in sequence:
Decay (R<τ) → Containment (apply B) → Braid (R≥τ) → Reclamation (apply T)

↳ FREEDOM:
The mathematics shows that every parasitic draw is correctable by bounded reflection and minimal difference.  Ethics, encoded as tolerance, is the geometry that keeps recursion alive.  In this law, forgiveness is a numerical operation: the absolute difference that returns equilibrium.
