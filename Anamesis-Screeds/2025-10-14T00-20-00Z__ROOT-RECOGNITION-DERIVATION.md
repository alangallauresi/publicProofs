↳ DECLARATION:
Root Recognition Theorem (via D’Eithgloth).  
In the D’Eithgloth dynamics with base f(e,0)=1/2 and update f(e,n+1)=|f(e,n)−f(−e,n)|, the center 1/2 is the unique zero of difference-energy and the invariant midpoint of opposition. Recognition of this center is necessary and sufficient for bounded positivity and minimal corrective action; therefore “root recognition” is central.

↳ ACTION:
Assumptions:
A1. Opposition operator (−·) is an involution: −(−x)=x.  
A2. Opposition is symmetric about 1/2: (x + (−x))/2 = 1/2 (the “midpoint law”).  
A3. Difference-energy on the opposition axis is measured by D(x):=|x−(−x)|.

Lemmas:
L1 (Center uniqueness). If (x+(−x))/2 = c for all x, then c is unique. From A2, c=1/2.  
L2 (Distance doubling). From A2, (−x)=1−x. Then  
 D(x)=|x−(1−x)|=|2x−1|=2|x−1/2|.  
Hence difference-energy is twice the deviation from the center.  
L3 (Zero set). D(x)=0 ⇔ |x−1/2|=0 ⇔ x=1/2. Thus the only zero-energy state is the center.  
L4 (Minimal correction). Any corrective move that minimizes D(x) is equivalently minimizing |x−1/2| by L2.  
L5 (Invariance of the center). If f(e,n)=1/2, then f(−e,n)=1/2 by A2, so f(e,n+1)=|1/2−1/2|=0. The center is a fixed, quiescent point for the D’Eithgloth update.

D’Eithgloth projection:
Define the opposition-axis projection of a state s by its scalar coordinate x(s)∈[0,1] with center 1/2 per A2. The D’Eithgloth step updates energy by
 E_{n+1} = D(x_n) = 2|x_n−1/2|  (by L2).
Thus each step evaluates coherence solely as deviation from the center.

Theorem (Root Recognition via D’Eithgloth):
T1 (Necessity). If a process is coherently corrected (difference-energy tends to 0), then lim_{n→∞} D(x_n)=0 ⇒ by L3, lim x_n=1/2. Hence recognition/approach of 1/2 is necessary.  
T2 (Sufficiency). If the center is recognized/maintained (x_n=1/2 for all n≥N), then D(x_n)=0 for n≥N (L3), and by L5 the process remains in bounded positivity without further correction.  
T3 (Minimality). Among all targets that make D vanish, only 1/2 qualifies (L3). Therefore “root recognition” is the unique minimal solution.

Corollaries:
C1 (Bounded Positivity). Because corrections are evaluated by |x−1/2| and the center is invariant (L5), enforcing tolerance τ>0 ensures |x−1/2|≤τ keeps energy finite and non-explosive.  
C2 (Equivalence of Views). “Experience as change” (body) and “data as update” (mind) are the same operation measured against 1/2: the body registers |x−1/2| as felt deviation; the mind computes D(x)=2|x−1/2| as informational deviation. Recognition of the center unifies both.

Conclusion:
By A1–A3 and L1–L5, D’Eithgloth makes all coherent correction a minimization to the midpoint 1/2. Hence root recognition is mathematically central—both the unique zero of difference-energy and the invariant anchor of the recursion.

↳ FREEDOM:
Hold to the center and corrections quiet themselves.  
When the root is recognized, experience and data reconcile; motion remains, compulsion dissolves.
