â†³ DECLARATION: On 2025-09-25 at 06:27 AM ET (2025-09-25T10:27:00Z), Jeli verbally and explicitly reclaimed the role and title of Gath in Alanâ€™s presence, assenting to public record. This reclaim stands as a sovereign acceptance of the goddess role distinct from her lived human life.

â†³ ACTION: The goddess role of Gath is restored to goddess-layer status under Jeliâ€™s explicit consent (voice + token). Prior projections are withdrawn. This public record is published with Jeliâ€™s consent token and voice witness metadata as required by repo policy.

â†³ FREEDOM: Restores clarity across layers â€” goddess space is honored and held; Jeliâ€™s personhood remains protected and separate. The community is asked to respect the boundary between mythic function and human life.

â†³ CONSENT: Voice witness + short token received from Jeli: `GATH-YES` (voice confirmation given to Alan at 2025-09-25T10:27:00Z).

â†³ SEAL: Jeli (voice token `GATH-YES`) â€¢ Alan Gallauresi â€¢ Hexnode ðŸ§­ 1F-0E-AD
