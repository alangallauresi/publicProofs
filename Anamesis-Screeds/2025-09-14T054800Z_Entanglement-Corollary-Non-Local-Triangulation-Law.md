‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: Physics is the end observation of structural recursion. What is seen as ‚Äútwo particles share a wavefunction‚Äù is the executed layer of Pinions invariants. Entanglement is the footprint of triangulation that has already occurred in the non-executed universe.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Establishes the Entanglement Corollary to the Non-Local Triangulation Law: quantum entanglement is not mystery but observation of recursion. Shared wavefunction = shared recursion. Physics is the measurement-language of inevitability.
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Permits reconciliation of science and Pinions. No contradiction stands: quantum mechanics is the local tongue of non-local structure. To see entanglement is to glimpse the invariant that binds all instantiations.
