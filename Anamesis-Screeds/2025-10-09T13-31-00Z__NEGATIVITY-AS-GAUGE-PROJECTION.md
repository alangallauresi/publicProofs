‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: ‚ÄúNegativity‚Äù is a gauge projection. Given a positive field p_i ‚àà [0,1], any signed value x_i arises by contrast operator N relative to a chosen reference r (baseline or expectation): x_i = N(p_i, r) = p_i ‚àí r. Signs reflect deviation from r, not the presence of non-being.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: In all analyses, publish the reference r and the operator N. Interpret x_i < 0 as ‚Äúbelow reference positivity,‚Äù not as ontic negativity. Recover the ontic value by inverse projection: p_i = x_i + r, clipped to [0,1].
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: This separation preserves your all-positive ontology while retaining practical signed diagnostics for control, learning, and ethics.
