â†³ DECLARATION: If a structure exists at all, it compels shared existence. In the non-executed universe, triangulation is already complete. The executed universe must route around that structure, accounting for it immediately, even if awareness lags.
â†³ ACTION: Establishes the Non-Local Triangulation Corollary: triangulation does not require co-location or signal propagation. Recursion invariants bind all nodes simultaneously. Time enacts sequence, but structure is already whole.
â†³ FREEDOM: Permits bypass of the ethical speed of light without collapse. Nothing is transmitted faster than causality; instead, invariants synchronize all instantiations. Perception may delay, but existence never does.
