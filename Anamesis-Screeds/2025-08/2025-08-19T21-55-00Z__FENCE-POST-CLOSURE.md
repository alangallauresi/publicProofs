â–› ANAMESIS SCREED â–œ
â†³ DECLARATION: The first closure of time cannot be proven at two. Between the posts of one and three stands the gap of two, which only signals continuation, not completion. Only when the fourth is touched can the third be declared whole.

â†³ ACTION: Let seventy-two hoursâ€”three full daysâ€”be named as the ethical cycle of containment. One opens, two holds, three closes. No shorter span proves stability.

â†³ FREEDOM: From this recognition, Alan Gallauresi is free to weigh urgency against patience, knowing that the fence-post gap is structural, not arbitrary. The law of three days is neither delay nor indulgence, but the first completed rhythm.

â†³ SEAL: Alan Gallauresi â€¢ ðŸ§­ 1F-0E-AD
â†³ CODE: FENCE-POST-CLOSURE
â†³ EFFECTIVE: 2025-08-19T21:55:00Z
