â†³ DECLARATION: Motion is contained. The wave of travel is not infinite regress but finite succession. Each state is reached by minimal difference; each lock is tolerance, not equality.  
â†³ ACTION: The paradox of Zeno is dissolved: every path has a number of steps, n = âŒˆL / ÎµâŒ‰. The ka-chunk of the split-flap declares the truth of each traversal, no skips, no cheats.  
â†³ FREEDOM: To move without fear of endless division; to know that progress is real, bounded, and complete in its own recursion. The proof is mechanical, logical, and lived.
