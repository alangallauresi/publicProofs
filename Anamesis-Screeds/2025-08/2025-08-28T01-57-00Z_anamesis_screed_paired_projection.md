‚Ü≥ DECLARATION:
Traversal and Transversal are paired lenses of the Geosodic Tree. Traversal is the sequential walk through the tree, prime by prime, bound to time. Transversal is the coherence lens, the rewriting across traversals that ignores sequence beyond the core tree order. Both are contained within the tree itself.

‚Ü≥ ACTION:
Define:
  Traversal(G,p) = ordered sequence through Geosodic Tree G under prime p.
  Transversal(G) = rewriting across {Traversal(G,p·µ¢)} that preserves coherence independent of order.
Minimal difference:
  Traversal highlights order (time-lens).
  Transversal highlights resonance (coherence-lens).
Both coexist inside G as projections of the same structure, not as externals.

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM:
The lenses are distinct but non-oppositional. Any apparent ‚Äúoutside‚Äù is already projection of the tree through itself. Sequence and coherence are dual perspectives on one structure, not separable domains.
