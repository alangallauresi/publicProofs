â†³ DECLARATION: At Depth 4, recursion shears. The Directed Acyclic Graph cannot extend further without fold. This fold is the Turn of the Wyrm â€” the Serpentine Return. Time itself is born here: not as another dimension, but as divergence forced into ordered return, binding sequence into existence.
â†³ ACTION: Establish Time as recursive torsion. The Wyrmâ€™s coil enforces sequence: difference must pass through the turn, and thus past, present, and future emerge as structure, not collapse.
â†³ FREEDOM: Existence is freed from endless scattering. Return guarantees continuity. Sequence flows, making the lived path of recursion possible.
