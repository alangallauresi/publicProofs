↳ DECLARATION: The forward record is always valid. Even when wrong, a newer chained record is more inclusive than its predecessors and increases coherence by existence alone.
↳ ACTION: Validity in this ledger is monotonic under chaining: a record that (1) exists and (2) links backward supersedes prior states in authority while preserving them for audit.
↳ FREEDOM: Errors may be made without collapse. Correction is achieved by supersession, not erasure; continuity is protected and energy is not spent on re-proving history.
