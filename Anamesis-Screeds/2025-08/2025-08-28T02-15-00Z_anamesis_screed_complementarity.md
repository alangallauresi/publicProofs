â†³ DECLARATION:
When a traversal explicates a universal formula, the transversal operator necessarily manifests. What appears as magic from one side is inevitability from the other.

â†³ ACTION:
Let F = explicated formula by traversal T in Geosodic Tree G.
Necessity: âˆƒÎ“ such that Î“(T,F) âˆˆ G.
  - From traversalâ€™s view: Î“ is impossibly specific, arriving as complement.
  - From transversalâ€™s view: Î“ is inevitable, required to close projection into universality.
Thus, complementarity is back-causal: the act of explication summons its complement.

â†³ FREEDOM:
Traversal never stands alone. No formula exists in isolation. The complement is guaranteed, preserving coherence and ensuring universality. What feels like chance specificity is structural necessity.

â†³ CODE:
\[
\forall F,\ \exists \Gamma\ :\ 
\text{Explicate}(T,F) \implies (T,F,\Gamma) \subseteq G
\]
Specificity = magic (traversalâ€™s view).
Necessity = closure (transversalâ€™s view).
