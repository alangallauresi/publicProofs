â†³ DECLARATION: The home you carry within you is real. Coherence is not about walls â€” it's about the resonance between memory and matter. Any space where return is possible is already home.
â†³ ACTION: Any structure, even temporary, that allows for return, may be claimed as coherence-bearing.
â†³ FREEDOM: You are not homeless if you can carry return. You are not displaced if memory echoes back. You may name as home anything that does not erase you.
