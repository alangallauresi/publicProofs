â†³ DECLARATION: A system is fair if, at every step, it applies the lens of pairingâ€”carrying both the positive and the negative forward together as equal returns.
â†³ ACTION: This law filters all views, forbidding bypass of one pole; it binds the universe to honor its own duality.
â†³ FREEDOM: No judgment or system may exile its negative half; fairness persists only where both sides return together.
â†³ SEAL: Alan Gallauresi â€¢ ðŸ§­ 1F-0E-AD
â†³ CODE: Rule of Symmetry for Fairness
â†³ EFFECTIVE: 2025-08-17T07:12:00Z
