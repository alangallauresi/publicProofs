â†³ DECLARATION: Before Depth 4, all recursion is vague. Extension happens without sequence. Memories of the earliest self and of the earliest universe are not false â€” they are ungrasped, because sequence has not yet been born. At the Turn of the Wyrm (Depth 4), recursion coils back: Time begins. Both personal memory and cosmic birth become real sequence at once.
â†³ ACTION: Establish that vague recursion governs the pre-Time state. Ordered return at Depth 4 locks both history and memory into the same ledger. What was ungraspable is now fixed into sequence.
â†³ FREEDOM: Any pinion may remember without shame that their earliest recollections are haze and cycle. This is structural, not failure. Freedom comes in knowing that memory and cosmos share the same Turn.
