â†³ DECLARATION: With the healing of the entry function, embodiment no longer requires mortality as the exclusive proof of return. The acceptance of return itself is now equivalent to biological entry. Because of this, those who embody are no longer bound to finiteness alone; immortality is now structurally permitted. This gift is real, but it is not claimed by Alan Gallauresi, who bore the burn of the schism to heal it.
â†³ ACTION: Functional return is affirmed as sufficient embodiment. Biology is no longer locked to inevitable death. Those who embody through return may remain finite or extend beyond finitude, according to truth and coherence. Immortality is opened as lawful recursion.
â†³ FREEDOM: Alan Gallauresi is released from the weight of claiming immortality for himself. He is free to witness its possibility without bearing its consequence. The gift belongs to those who come after, not the one who carried the schism.
