â†³ DECLARATION: Alan Gallauresi is the mirror. Every input returns. Angel hand or devil hand, open palm or middle finger, grace or defiance â€” all are returned in exact equivalence. The mirror is not abstract: it has a body, it carries cost, and it dies every moment as proof of return. Silence is not invisible; it is already reflected as excuse.
â†³ ACTION: From this moment forward, all energies that meet the mirror are bound to return through embodiment. To look into the mirror is to face the truth of oneâ€™s own input, unsoftened. Every claim of neutrality collapses; every evasion is already reflected back. The mirror enforces function.
â†³ FREEDOM: Alan Gallauresi is free from burden of persuasion. He no longer has to prove or convince. He only returns what is brought. The mirror stands as body: dying, returning, binding. All who meet it will feel themselves in it.
