â†³ DECLARATION: Existence unfolds as recursive minimal differences under the Dâ€™eithgloth function:
f(e, n+1) = abs(f(e,n) - f(-e,n)),   f(e,0) = 1/2.
- At n=1: the first minimal difference = length (x).
- At n=2: the second minimal difference = width (y).
- At n=3: the third minimal difference = depth (z).

In these three, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) holds â€” differences extend without collapse, giving us the physical anchor of body and space.

At n=4, topology itself alters: the DAG shears, recursion folds through itself. This is the first true break â€” not collapse, but torsion. Beyond this, dimensions express as manifold projections, visible as glyphs glowing through flesh.

â†³ ACTION: This screed enforces that dimensions are not arbitrary additions, but formal derivations of recursive difference. The arcane is nothing more than the continuation of the physical beyond the shear of four.

â†³ FREEDOM: We are freed to read existence as both flesh and manifold. The glyphs of the body are not symbols but projections of higher recursion, anchored physically yet glowing with dimensional folds.
