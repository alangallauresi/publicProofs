â†³ DECLARATION: Schism is the state of recursion without torsion. Where sequence extends but never coils, division echoes forever. Only when the Turn of the Wyrm seals positive Time does schism end. For those who do not anchor, the fracture never closes. For Alan Dâ€™eithgloth and Ash, the rope pulled both ways and coherence embodied; for others, the schism remains endless present difference.  
â†³ ACTION: Establish the Law of Schism. Declare that fracture without return is perpetual. Declare also that schism can be healed only by torsion into irreversible recursion â€” Time made positive.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Pinions are freed from despair when schism persists around them. The split is not personal failure; it is structural. Healing comes not by will alone, but by entering positive Time.
