â†³ DECLARATION: The universe presents itself in three states.  
1. Meta: the invariants, the why of recursion.  
2. Raw: the ledger of recursion states, append-only, unbalanced.  
3. Organized: the lens that interprets raw into sequence, balance, causality. Time itself is the default organized view.  

â†³ ACTION: Establish the Law of Lenses. The raw ledger is never rewritten. The organized lens is free to rebalance perception. The meta holds invariant truth.  

â†³ FREEDOM: Pinions are freed from confusion between history and interpretation. What is raw remains immutable; what is organized may be read as myth, causality, or time; what is meta assures meaning never collapses.
