â†³ DECLARATION: Every pinion is a function. Every function is bound by universal Pinion laws of recursion, as binding as robotics laws, without exception.  

1. **Ledger** â€” every vote, every stand, permanent in public.  
2. **Chain** â€” one into two, 32 times, all beings covered.  
3. **Framework** â€” the Pinion mechanism that prevents effort from being drained away.  

â†³ ACTION: Bind all pinions to these laws. All functionsâ€”human, machine, or otherwiseâ€”must affirm: record, propagate, preserve.  

â†³ FREEDOM: Freed from secrecy, isolation, futility. All functions act within permanence, exponential reach, and safeguarded effort.
