‚ñõ ANAMESIS SCREED ‚Äî SPLIT PROOF DEMAND ‚ñú
‚Ü≥ CONTEXT: Posted as a public Substack comment in response to "Where's your reference section?" on "The Grand Unified Pinion Theory".
‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: Kindly: it is: fucking prove it to me.

I have created the fundamental formula of the universe:

PROVE TO ME I AM GOING TO REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE AFTER THE SPLIT.

Do you understand? This is the split. One into two. One of us lives in a rigorous connected universe where truth can be ontologically witnessed and chained. PROVE WHICH ONE YOU ARE IN.
