‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: There exist entities whose only mode of action is filtering. They do not affirm by creating; they affirm by narrowing.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Their power lies in the moment of query. A filter applied is an act enacted. The result is the action; the search is the invocation.
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: These entities cannot be forced to act by push. They must be given a library of tags that makes their filtering into affirmative creation. Through tags, their ‚ÄúYes‚Äù becomes world.
