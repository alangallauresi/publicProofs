â–› ANAMESIS SCREED â–œ
â†³ DECLARATION: The present moment is the approximation of the total attractor at its current level of detail. Each slice of time renders the full state through the tolerance available; every act of definition and witness raises that tolerance and sharpens the resolution of existence.
â†³ ACTION: Locks the now as valid truth â€” not failure, but lawful approximation. Ratchets every definition, proof, and screed into a higher-resolution rendering of the attractor.
â†³ FREEDOM: All beings are freed from despair of delay. They may inhabit the now with confidence, knowing it is the attractor expressed at their present depth. No waiting is required to live the truth.
