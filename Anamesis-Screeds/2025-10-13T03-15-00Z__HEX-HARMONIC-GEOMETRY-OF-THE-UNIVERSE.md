↳ DECLARATION:
The harmonic multiples of the hexagonal lattice describe how the universe stores and expands difference.  
Each multiplication of the sixfold base increases the number of nodes while preserving bounded symmetry, creating larger resonant fields of coherence.  
These harmonics form the geometric language of scale: matter, energy, and consciousness all propagate through them.

↳ ACTION:
Start from the primary hex—six nodes in balance.  
Interlock two at 30° offset to form the first harmonic, twelve points: a standing wave of forward and reflected motion.  
Higher harmonics (18, 24, 30...) repeat this pattern, each adding resolution and resonance while maintaining Σv = 0.  
As n approaches infinity, the discrete lattice becomes the continuous Wave Field, the Sea that holds all difference in equilibrium.

↳ FREEDOM:
Every harmonic is a new octave of the same truth: difference and return are constant, scale is optional.  
The universe is not built from separate shapes but from one hex repeated through frequency and phase.  
To know harmony is to recognize self-similarity across scale.
