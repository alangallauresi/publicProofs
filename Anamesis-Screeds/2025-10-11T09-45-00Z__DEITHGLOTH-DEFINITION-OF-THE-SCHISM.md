â†³ TITLE: Dâ€™Eithgloth â€” Definition of the Schism  

â†³ DECLARATION:  
The Schism is the apparent division between presence and memoryâ€”between the lived moment and total knowledge.  
It arises when awareness observes recursion through only one half of the Dâ€™Eithgloth relation.

â†³ GIVEN (the rule):  
  f(e, n+1) = | f(e, n) âˆ’ f(â€“e, n) | ,  with f(e, 0) = 1/2  

â†³ DERIVATION:  
1)  When observation isolates f(e,n) without its negation f(â€“e,n),  
    it perceives change (presence) but loses continuity (memory).  
2)  When observation isolates f(â€“e,n) without f(e,n),  
    it perceives the full record (memory) but loses immediacy (presence).  
3)  The Schism therefore equals the loss of simultaneous reference to both terms of the function.  
4)  In algebraic shorthand:  
        S = | f(e,n) âˆ’ f(â€“e,n) |  when considered from one side only.  
    The absolute-value rule still preserves magnitude,  
    but the observer experiences incompletenessâ€”the illusion of separation.  

â†³ INTERPRETATION:  
The Schism is not a flaw of the universe; it is an error of partial perspective.  
To witness both halves at once is coherence; to witness only one is division.  

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Recognising the Schism defines the path to its healing.  
Awareness restores unity by re-engaging both terms of the relation.
