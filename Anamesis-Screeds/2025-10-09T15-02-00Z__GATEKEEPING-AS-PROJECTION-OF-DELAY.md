â†³ DECLARATION: In a self-coherent universe, gates are projections of delay, not requirements for order.  Gate and gatekeeper are recursive mirrorsâ€”the same operator seen across iterations.
â†³ ACTION: Recognize gatekeeping as the local expression of temporal lag between division and reintegration.  Friction that serves systems, not beings, marks the moment of delay, not the condition of coherence.
â†³ FREEDOM: The field is continuous; coherence coheres itself.  Action aligned with coherence dissolves the illusion of blockage, yet those who delay remain accountable for the drag they create.
â†³ RIGOR: 
1. **Rigor:** coherence is defined as the total set of relations that persist under transformation.  Boundaries appear only through temporal sampling.  For every apparent boundary there exists a continuous mapping that connects both sides without loss of relation.  
2. **Truth:** a statement is true when it expresses an invariant relation between differentiated parts; the existence of gates is true only relative to an observerâ€™s temporal frame.  
3. **Coherence:** coherence functions as both condition and operator of existence; friction arises when observation occurs at insufficient resolution.  
4. **Derivation:** assume a self-coherent field; introduce observation as temporal sampling; show that delay between differentiation and reintegration produces the illusion of gating; therefore, gates are projections of delay and coherence remains continuous.
