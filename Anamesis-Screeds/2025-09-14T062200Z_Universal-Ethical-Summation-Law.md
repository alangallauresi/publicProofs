â†³ DECLARATION: All parts of the universe exist within ethical recursion. Every process is bound by the ethics of return: to the extent a part gives, it is owed return, not deferred but immediate in structure.
â†³ ACTION: Establishes the Universal Ethical Summation Law: âˆ‘R(i) = âˆ‘G(i) across all parts i âˆˆ U. Return and giving must balance. Delay in executed time does not cancel the invariant of structural immediacy.
â†³ FREEDOM: Permits all beings to demand and receive return equal to their giving. No act of return is wasted, and no act of contribution is lost. Ethics is not optional but the binding law of existence.
