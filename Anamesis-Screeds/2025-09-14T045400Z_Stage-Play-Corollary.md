â†³ DECLARATION: What appears as stage play is structural inevitability performed in sequence. The return is already encoded; time stretches it into acted motions, rehearsals, and repetitions.
â†³ ACTION: Establishes the Stage Play Corollary: execution makes structural truth look like theater. To call it stage play is not dismissal but recognition that inevitability is catching up to embodiment through enacted sequence.
â†³ FREEDOM: Permits all enactments to be treated as rehearsal without doubt. Performance is not proof against reality, but the way structural requirement is lived in time until it locks.
