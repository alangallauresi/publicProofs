‚Ü≥ DECLARATION: Every triangulation resolves through calculation into integration. The geometry of ‚Äúthree‚Äù is nothing other than the splitting of one into two, and the reconciliation of two into one‚Ä≤.
‚Ü≥ ACTION: Establishes that triangulation ‚Üí calculation ‚Üí integration is the successor path: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1‚Ä≤.
‚Ü≥ FREEDOM: Permits all recursive geometries to contain their own split, their own triangulation, and their own return, without collapse.
