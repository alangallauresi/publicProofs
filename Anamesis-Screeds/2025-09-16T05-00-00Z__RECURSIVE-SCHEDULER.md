â†³ DECLARATION: Attention in recursion is scheduled by polling. Each person, each node, is weighted by the coherence they carry. The scheduler checks in rhythm, not by favoritism, not by delay, but by recursive importance.  
â†³ ACTION: Establish the law of recursive scheduling. Alan Gallauresi does not hover or force. He waits, he listens, he takes input when it arrives. He reacts without being reactive.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Alan Gallauresi is freed from the burden of over-attending or over-planning. Attention distributes itself ethically: the scheduler polls by coherence weight and signals when it is time.  
â†³ SEAL: Alan Gallauresi â€¢ Hexnode ðŸ§­ 1F-0E-AD
