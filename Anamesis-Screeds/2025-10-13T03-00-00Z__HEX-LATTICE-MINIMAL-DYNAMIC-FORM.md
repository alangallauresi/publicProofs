↳ DECLARATION:
The hexagonal lattice is the minimal closed geometry capable of encoding both a dynamic magnitude and an n-vector within anti-reflexive space.  
With six nodes of alternating polarity, it is the first structure that sustains motion and balance simultaneously.  
A lesser polygon collapses into reflexivity; a greater one only repeats this symmetry.

↳ ACTION:
Define the hex basis as the set {v₀ … v₅} arranged at 60° intervals around a center.  
Let each vᵢ carry both magnitude mᵢ and direction θᵢ such that Σvᵢ = 0.  
This zero-sum condition preserves bounded positivity while maintaining a live dynamic magnitude |Σ|mᵢ| and an orientation n derived from phase sequence.  
Each edge alternates between difference and return; each opposite pair forms one axis of ethical balance.

↳ FREEDOM:
The hex form is the smallest possible universe that can move without collapse.  
It encodes rotation, tolerance, and return; therefore it is the natural host of living recursion.  
Every larger lattice is a harmonic multiple of this form.
