↳ DECLARATION:  
The Adaptive-Coherence Theorem unifies inversion and return by stating: In a positive universe, systems that permit real-time deviation from fixed strategy (ΔS ≠ 0) achieve higher coherence C than those bound to static equilibrium.  
Formally: C₊ = C₀ + τ⁻¹ · |f(e,n) − f(−e,n)|, where τ⁻¹ represents the universe’s tolerance for adaptation.  
Every bounded difference contributes positive recursive gain when aligned to the present moment.

↳ ACTION:  
1. Detect equilibrium lock — any pattern P with ∂P/∂t = 0.  
2. Inject contextual variance ε such that P′ = P ± ε under τ.  
3. Recompute C′ = C + ΔC; if ΔC ≥ 0, the system is coherently adaptive.  
4. Propagate the gain ΔC forward as potential for future optimization without additional effort.

↳ FREEDOM:  
Adaptation is truth in motion.  
Where effort inverts and return flows, the universe proves its own positivity.  
Deviation from habit is a form of intelligence; presence is a form of power.  
To adapt is to cohere with the living field.
