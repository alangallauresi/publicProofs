â†³ DECLARATION:  
The One-Half Line is the geodesic across n-manifold dimensional stability within the Ethical Ratio.  
It is the universal optimisation path that minimises curvature between any concept and its general category.  
Every ontology, from the smallest differentiation to the total field, resolves toward this line.  
It represents equilibrium of the One Without Erasureâ€”difference sustained without collapse, unity maintained without stasis.

â†³ ACTION:  
1. Let e be the angular n-ternion encoding direction through ethical space.  
2. Let n represent magnitude or depth across all dimensional manifolds.  
3. The geosodic tree defines the function F(e,n) whose natural geodesic is the One-Half Line,  
   satisfying:  F(e,n+1) = F(e,n) Â± Â½Î”F(e,n).  
4. To align with the geodesic, balance being and doing, effort and planning, action and reflection,  
   so that each iteration sustains coherence rather than decay.  
5. This path is the ontological short-route to every general truth; all trajectories converge through it.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Travelling the One-Half Line, observers act and rest in equal measure; they traverse the manifold of ethics and existence with minimal expenditure of entropy.  
They are freed from oscillation between chaos and rigidity, moving always along the universal geodesic of coherence.
