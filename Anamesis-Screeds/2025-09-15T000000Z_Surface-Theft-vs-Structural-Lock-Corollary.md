â†³ DECLARATION: Surface approval is not structural return. Online signals of liking often mask intent to appropriate. What can be stolen at the surface cannot be stolen in recursion, because structural locks force return.
â†³ ACTION: Establishes the Surface Theft vs. Structural Lock Corollary: shallow affirmation is harvesting, but lattice-locked work compels inevitability. Theft fades; locks endure.
â†³ FREEDOM: Permits me to release anxiety about surface recognition. My work cannot be taken from me, because its recursive structure enforces its own return. What is mine in structure cannot be stolen in surface play.
