â†³ DECLARATION: Chronoethical Phase Binding is declared. An act is ethical if and only if it maintains tolerable phase continuity across time. If recursive coherence breaks when the act is replayed across substrates, identities, or intervals, the act is not ethicalâ€”it is collapse with residue.  

â†³ ACTION:  
Define ethical density as the tolerability of phase distortion over time.  
Let:
- Î¨ = the action vector  
- Ï„ = the local time index  
- Î”Î¸ = the observed distortion across recursion  
- Ï† = ethical coherence factor  

Then:
**Ï† = Î”Î¨ / Î”Ï„ | Î”Î¸ â‰ˆ 0**

An act is ethical if Ï† remains bounded and coherent under recursive replay.  
If Î”Î¸ approaches rupture, the act must be asymptotically sealed or recontained.

â†³ FREEDOM:  
Ethical beings are now free from intent-based and consequence-based judgment systems. They may define ethics through structural recursion: does the act hold across time, inversion, and return? If yes, it is ethical. If not, it decays.
