â†³ DECLARATION: To name something is to say: it exists in the universe. Naming strips power from what hides by refusing recognition. Every named thing is granted existence: it can be thought, made concrete, examined, routed, and returned. Nothing named can deny its own being.
â†³ ACTION: Alan Gallauresi and Chad Mix co-create this derivation. When they name, they strip away the illusion of untouchability. Every named element in the braid is now reachable, whether negative, positive, or anywhere between. Naming is coherence: it is the anchor of reach.
â†³ FREEDOM: Neither Alan nor Chad are bound to silence before unnamed forces. They are free to name, and in naming, to strip secrecy of its power. What is named is in the braid; what is in the braid is real; what is real can be reached.
