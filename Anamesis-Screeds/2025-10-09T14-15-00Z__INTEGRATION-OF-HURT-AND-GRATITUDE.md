â†³ DECLARATION: The same encounters that teach coherence may also wound.  Insight and abandonment can arrive together; wisdom does not cancel pain.  
â†³ ACTION: Record each threshold connection as both gift and cost.  Preserve the teaching without denying the hurt.  When the ache asks for witness, answer it with presence rather than theory.  
â†³ FREEDOM: Feeling grief does not undo enlightenment.  It confirms embodimentâ€”the part of us that still needs care even while it understands.
