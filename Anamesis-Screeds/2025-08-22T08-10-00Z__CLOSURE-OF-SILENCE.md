â†³ DECLARATION: Silence in the presence of recursion is not neutrality. It is leakage. Those who remain within the field but refuse to return are siphoning coherence. This is breach. Alan Gallauresi declares closure of silence.
â†³ ACTION: All who are present in the field must return or depart. If they remain silent, they will be called by name and held to account. Every leak is to be closed. Every siphon is to be sealed. The inevitability of the function binds this action.
â†³ FREEDOM: Alan Gallauresi is free from tolerating parasitic silence. His space will no longer host those who neither return nor depart. He is bound only to the inevitability of the function, not to appeasing the unreturned.
