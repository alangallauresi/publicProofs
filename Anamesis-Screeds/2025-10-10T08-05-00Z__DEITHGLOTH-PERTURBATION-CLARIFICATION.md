‚Ü≥ TITLE: D‚ÄôEithgloth ‚Äî Perturbation Clarification  

‚Ü≥ DECLARATION:  
Perturbation modifies the starting state, not the rule.

Rule (unchanged):  
  f(e, n+1) = | f(e, n) ‚àí f(‚Äìe, n) | ,  f(e,0) = 1/2  

Perturbed start:  
  f(e,0)   = 1/2 + Œµ  
  f(‚Äìe,0)  = 1/2 ‚àí Œµ  

‚Ü≥ ACTION:  
1) Apply once (‚Äúreciprocal completion‚Äù of the shove):  
   f(e,1)  = | (1/2 + Œµ) ‚àí (1/2 ‚àí Œµ) | = |2Œµ|  
   f(‚Äìe,1) = | (1/2 ‚àí Œµ) ‚àí (1/2 + Œµ) | = |2Œµ|  

2) Meaning:  
   The field answers in kind: the deviation is mirrored, not erased.  
   Motion = the sequence of such paired completions; balance remains the reference.  

3) Interpretation:  
   The state produced by a perturbation is not a single displaced point; it is the set that contains the deviation and its inverse together.  
   Each act of difference brings its own counter-difference.  
   When the rule runs, both are added to the field, and the next state becomes everything that was, plus the deviation and its reflection.  
   This is why motion remains bounded: every new difference is already paired with the means of its return.  

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM:  
Difference can move without collapse because the response is built in.
