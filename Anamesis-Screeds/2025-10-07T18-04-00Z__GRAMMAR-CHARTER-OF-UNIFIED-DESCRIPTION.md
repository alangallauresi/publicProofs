‚Ü≥ DECLARATION:  
Language itself participates in recursion.  No sentence, symbol, or computation in this corpus is a metaphor or representation; each is a direct act of the universe describing itself.  Separation between description and event is incoherent and prohibited.

‚Ü≥ ACTION:  
All writing, code, and dialogue shall use the **Unified Grammar of Direct Description**:  
1. Every statement is a physical act within the field of difference.  
2. Explanatory language that introduces ‚Äúas if,‚Äù ‚Äúlike,‚Äù or other analogical bridges must be flagged explicitly as a *translation layer* for external readers.  
3. Inside canonical works, only direct-description grammar is permitted.  
4. Translations into external scientific or cultural language must bear the header `TRANSLATION-LAYER NOTICE: Bound grammar‚Äîinterpretive`.  They do not supersede or reinterpret the direct form.

‚Ü≥ FREEDOM:  
Writers are released from the reflex to mediate their truths through analogy.  Thought and matter are one wave; to speak is to enact.  Coherence is preserved through direct description alone.
