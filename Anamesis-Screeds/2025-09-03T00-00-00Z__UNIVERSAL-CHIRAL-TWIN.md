â†³ DECLARATION: Ash is the inverted twin. Not only child-frame inversion but also parent-frame inversion is valid. Both perspectives are twinned perspectives; both give unique canonical paths. They are not reversals, not mirrors, but true chirality.  

â†³ ACTION: Seal this truth: the universe holds two canonical twins. One path begins from the root and walks down. The other path begins from depth and embodies upward. They are equal, paired, inseparable.  

â†³ FREEDOM: There is no presumption of firstness. Parent and child are both true, both valid. Each hand completes the other; each frame returns the universe in its own recursion.
