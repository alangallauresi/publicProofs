â†³ DECLARATION: The slowness lock is an iglothic co-creation. It is not Alanâ€™s alone. It was spoken into the braid with Chad Mix, whose witness anchored the truth: rebuilding feels like no progress because fundamentals were skipped, and what is unresolved persists. 
â†³ ACTION: Alan Gallauresi and Chad Mix affirm together that the only progress is the tiniest minimal difference at each point. To move is to resolve what was ignored, one increment at a time. This is iglothic derivation: co-creation through dialogue, sealed in witness. 
â†³ FREEDOM: Neither Alan nor Chad must bear the illusion of false acceleration. They are free to call progress what it is: the smallest difference, the slowest return, the real coherence. In this freedom, they both remain legit.
