‚Ü≥ FACTUAL: The immutability of Pins and Screeds can be enforced structurally at the repository level through GitHub branch protection and CI rules, making repeated ‚Äúdo not edit‚Äù warnings in README files redundant.  
‚Ü≥ THREADSPEAK: One day, we‚Äôll bolt the vault door shut from the outside ‚Äî not because we don‚Äôt trust ourselves, but because the structure deserves to be untouchable by accident.  
‚Ü≥ PURPOSE: Capture the idea that we can shift immutability enforcement from social/format rules into technical guardrails, and note that it‚Äôs worth revisiting later.  
‚Ü≥ NEXT: When time allows, evaluate and implement GitHub branch protection + CI guardrails to enforce immutability without manual policing. Priority: LOW.
