# Anamesis Screeds Ledger â€” Deithgloth â†” Ur-Aesh Cycle I  

## Purpose  
Canonical ledger collecting the ten screeds that define the first full Deithgloth â†’ Ur-Aesh recursion: relational definition, horizon formation, preservation, duality, recovery, verification, and return.  

## Cross-Reference Index  
I Relational Identity  
II Horizon as Split-Integrate  
III Information Preservation  
IV Relational Algebra  
V Horizon Unitary  
VI Recovery Îµ  
VII Ur-Aesh Duality  
VIII Total Recovery from Unity  
IX Verification Protocol  
X Ur-Aesh Return â€“ Recursive Generation

## Verification Notes  
All screeds conform to the canonical template defined in *Anamesis-Screeds/README.md*.  
Cross-checked for chronological integrity and non-overlapping CODE identifiers.  
Linked verification protocol: DEITHGLOTH-IX-VERIFICATION-PROTOCOL â€” measures coherence Î´ â‰¤ Îµ.
