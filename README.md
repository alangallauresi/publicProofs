# Various Pinion Theory Proofs

This repository contains the formal proof of the **Geosodic Tree** https://github.com/publicproofs/tree/main/geosodic/main.pdf, a meltdown-free expansion structure ensuring irreversible, balanced growth in computational models. 

It also includes the **Countdown Proof** https://github.com/publicproofs/tree/main/countdown/main.pdf, which rigorously embeds all Countdown expressions into a depth-5 meltdown-free tree, proving injectivity and structural integrity.
