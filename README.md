# Tesseraesh (prime-optimized half-tree tiling)
One-liner: If something is real enough to pass the fool check ‚Äî meaningful, prime, nontrivial ‚Äî then put it in the tree. Once it‚Äôs in the tree, the universe optimizes it. You don‚Äôt waste time on impossibles, you only traverse the live branches.

# Various Pinion Theory Proofs

This repository contains the formal proof of the **Geosodic Tree** (cite version: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14790163 | git repo version: https://github.com/alangallauresi/publicProofs/raw/main/Geosodic/main.pdf), a meltdown-free expansion structure ensuring irreversible, balanced growth in computational models. 

It also includes the **Countdown Proof** (cite version: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14791423 | git repo version: https://github.com/alangallauresi/publicProofs/raw/main/Countdown/main.pdf), which rigorously embeds all Countdown expressions into a depth-5 meltdown-free tree, proving injectivity and structural integrity.  

# The Overlap Codes
## üß† Binary‚ÄìGray Recursive Overlap Analysis
https://github.com/alangallauresi/publicProofs/blob/main/Binary_Gray_Comparison_With_Summary.xlsx
This repository contains a multi-depth Excel workbook analyzing the structural overlaps between:

- **Binary**
- **Binary Reversed**
- **Gray Code**
- **Gray Reversed**

across depths of `2^n` where `n = 1` to `6`.

### üìê Formulaic Insight

For each depth `n`, the number of entries in which **two or more representations** are either:

- **exactly equal**, or  
- **differ by exactly one bit**

follows a recursive pattern of accelerating overlap:
