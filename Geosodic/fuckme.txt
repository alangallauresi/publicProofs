# PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION

**Title:** Vetraxis: A Recursion Stability Tracker

## 1. Abstract

Vetraxis is a Recursion Stability Tracker designed to measure recursion state stability, enforce meltdown-free expansion, and determine transformation readiness across AI governance, legal precedent tracking, and economic modeling. This invention defines an irreversible recursion tracking model that assigns an alignment function to recursive expansion states, preventing structural contradictions and ensuring predictable convergence. The system applies to machine learning decision frameworks, distributed computing networks, and structured policy enforcement. Vetraxis incorporates an ethical evaluation component, ensuring all computations remain within predefined ethical bounds.

## 2. Technical Background

### 2.1 The Problem of Recursion Tracking

Recursive systems in AI, decision theory, and law often require a way to determine when an expanding structure has reached stability. Without a governing function, recursion can:

*   Oscillate unpredictably, leading to chaotic transformations.
*   Become unstable due to misaligned expansion paths.
*   Be exploited through adversarial transformations that bypass convergence checks.

This problem affects:

*   **AI & ML Governance:** Unstable reinforcement learning models can fail alignment tests due to uncontrolled recursion shifts.
*   **Legal Precedent Tracking:** Case law lacks recursion constraints, allowing selective precedent manipulation.
*   **Economic Decision Systems:** Recursive policy models lack stability enforcement, leading to unpredictable financial outcomes.

### 2.2 The Need for Recursion Stability Tracking

A recursion tracking system must:

*   **Track recursion alignment across expansion layers.**
*   **Ensure meltdown-free growth**, meaning past recursion states remain unaltered.
*   **Establish a mathematical threshold** for transformation readiness.

**Why recursion tracking is necessary:**
Without formal recursion tracking, systemic instabilities accumulate, leading to misalignment. Vetraxis enforces recursion stability as an AI-enforced governing function, making it the first self-reinforcing recursion tracker.

## 3. Summary of Invention

## 5. Detailed Description

### 5.1 Alignment Function for Recursion Tracking

Vetraxis assigns a stability score A(n) ∈ [0,1] to each recursion state n, represented as a *pinion* within a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). A *pinion* is an immutable unit of information representing a specific state, computation, or decision within the recursive process. Each pinion is the *minimal difference* from prior pinions.

*   A(n) → 1 means the pinion is fully stable and ready for use in further computations.
*   A(n) → 0 means the pinion is unstable and should not be used.

**Transformation Trigger:**

When A(n) reaches a predefined threshold (e.g., 0.95+), the pinion is considered "stable enough" for use in further computations or transformations. Since A(n) is asymptotic, transformation is permitted when it meets the stability threshold rather than requiring exact convergence to 1.

If A(n) reaches 1.00, the pinion is considered permanently stable and immutable.

*A(n)* is calculated as follows:

`A(n) = A(n-1) + k * (S(n) - A(n-1))`

where:

*   `A(n-1)` is the alignment score of the *most recent predecessor* pinion used in the creation of pinion 'n'. If 'n' has multiple predecessors, the minimum A(n-1) value is used.
*   `k` is a learning rate constant between 0.01 and 0.2, controlling the update speed.
*   `S(n)` is the *ideal* stability score for pinion 'n', calculated as a weighted average of component scores (described below).

If A(n) oscillates near the predefined threshold, the following time-weighted function may be applied to ensure stability before transformation is triggered:

`A(n) = ∑(t=1 to T) [w_t * A(n-t)] / ∑(t=1 to T) w_t`

where `w_t` is a decay-weighted factor ensuring stability over a bounded interval (specific weighting function to be defined in implementation).

**5.2 Component Scores of S(n)**

`S(n)` is calculated as a weighted average of three component scores:

`S(n) = (w_d * S_d(n) + w_h * S_h(n) + w_e * S_e(n)) / (w_d + w_h + w_e)`

where:

*   `w_d`, `w_h`, and `w_e` are weighting factors (between 0 and 1, summing to 1) representing the relative importance of each component score. Initially, `w_e` (the ethical score) is set to 0.8, `w_d` to 0.1, and `w_h` to 0.1, reflecting the priority of ethical considerations. These weights may be adjusted based on the application domain.
*   `S_d(n)`, `S_h(n)`, and `S_e(n)` are the component scores, defined below.

**5.2.1 Difference Score (S<sub>d</sub>(n))**

The Difference Score, S<sub>d</sub>(n), quantifies the *novelty* of a pinion 'n' relative to its immediate predecessors in the DAG. It measures the change in the *relational structure* of the DAG caused by adding 'n'.

**Calculation:**

1.  **Predecessor Relationships:** Let `pred(n)` be the set of immediate predecessors of pinion 'n'.  `E_pre` represents the set of all edges connecting pinions within `pred(n)` *before* the addition of 'n'.
2.  **Post-Addition Relationships:** `E_post` represents the set of all edges connecting pinions within `pred(n)` *and* including pinion 'n' *after* 'n' is added (including new edges from predecessors to 'n').
3.  **Edge Differences:**
    *   `E_new = E_post - E_pre` (New edges added).
    *   `E_removed = E_pre - E_post` (Edges removed – ideally, this set is empty in a meltdown-free system).
4.  **Weighted Sum:** Each edge *type* is assigned a weight (`weight(type)`) reflecting its significance. S<sub>d</sub>(n) is calculated as:

    `S_d(n) = 1 - exp(-α * [∑ (weight(type) * |edges of type in E_new|) - β * ∑ (weight(type) * |edges of type in E_removed|)])`

    *   `α` is a scaling factor (initially set to 1.0).
    *   `β` is a penalty factor for removed edges (significantly larger than other weights, initially set to 5.0).
    *    `avgDegree(n)` is the average degree of the predecessors of n, *not* including n.
    *  `Smax` is an upper-bound, initially set to 0.95.

**Edge Types and Weights (Initial Proposal):**

*   "implies" = 1.0
*   "generalizes" = 0.9
*   "refines" = 0.8
*   "exampleOf" = 0.7
*   "connects" = 0.5
*   "dependsOn" = 0.5
*   "alternativeTo" = 0.4
*   "contradicts" = N/A (handled separately, triggering validation)
*   "corrects" = N/A (handled in S<sub>h</sub>(n))

**Final Calculation**
`S_d(n) = min( 1 - exp(-(1/(1 + avgDegree(n))) * [∑ (weight(type) * |edges of type in E_new|) - β * ∑ (weight(type) * |edges of type in E_removed|)]), S_max )`

**5.2.2 Harmony Score (S<sub>h</sub>(n))**

The Harmony Score, S<sub>h</sub>(n), measures the *consistency* of a new pinion, 'n', with the existing knowledge structure within the Vetraxis Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

**Calculation:**

1.  **Relevant Pinion Set (`relevant(n)`):** Includes `pred(n)`, pinions reachable from `pred(n)` via "implies" or "generalizes" edges, and a pre-defined set of *Stabilizing Reference Pinions* (SRPs). SRPs are divided into:
    *   **Fixed SRPs:** Representing fundamental, unchanging principles.
    *   **Evolving SRPs:** Representing principles that may be refined through a rigorous, multi-step validation process, triggered by a "corrects" edge and requiring a high threshold of consensus.

2.  **Harmony Checks:** Domain-specific consistency checks are performed between `data(n)` and the data of pinions in `relevant(n)`. Examples:

    *   **Logical Contradiction Detection:** If pinions represent logical propositions, use standard logical reasoning (e.g., a SAT solver) to check for contradictions. *Example:* If `relevant(n)` contains "A implies B," and `data(n)` is "A and not B," a contradiction is detected.
    *   **Mathematical Validity:** If pinions represent mathematical expressions, check for syntactic correctness, division by zero, etc. *Example:* If `data(n)` is "1/0," it's flagged as invalid.
    *   **Constraint Satisfaction:** If pinions represent configurations or decisions, verify compliance with pre-defined constraints. *Example:* In resource allocation, if `data(n)` allocates more resources than available, it violates a constraint.

**Three-Tier Contradiction Handling:**
    *   **Direct Logical Contradiction:** Handled via standard logic validation.
    *   **Systemic Coherence Violation:** Requires deeper analysis, potentially involving multiple pinions and their relationships.
    *   **Ethical Violations:** Checked against Sₑ(n).

3.  **Scoring:**

    *   `S_h(n)` begins at 1 (perfect harmony).
    *   For each failed check, a penalty `p_i` (between 0 and 1, reflecting severity) is applied.
    *   **Weighted Sum:** `S_h(n) = 1 - (∑ w_i * p_i) / (∑ w_i)`
        *   `p_i`: Penalty for the i-th failed check.
        *   `w_i`: Weight for the i-th check (reflecting importance). Logical contradictions have significantly higher weight than minor constraint violations.
    *   Lower Bound: `S_h(n)` is bounded below by 0.

**Handling "Corrects" Edges:**

*   A "corrects" edge from `n1` to `n2` indicates `n2` corrects an inconsistency in `n1`.
*   `n1` remains in the DAG (meltdown-free).
*   The system prioritizes `n2` in subsequent computations. A "cooldown period," implemented through recursive validation over multiple subsequent pinions, ensures `n2` is stable before it fully replaces `n1`.

**5.2.3 Ethical Score (S<sub>e</sub>(n))**

The Ethical Score, S<sub>e</sub>(n), assesses the alignment of pinion 'n' with the ethical constraints of the Vetraxis system. This score ensures that all computations and actions remain within a defined ethical range, preventing the creation of pinions that represent harmful, unethical, or destabilizing actions.

**Calculation:**

1.  **Pinion Action:** Define `action(n)` as the *action* or *computation* represented by pinion 'n'.
2.  **Ethical Bounds:** All ethical actions, and therefore pinions representing the results of those actions, are defined to be within the range of 50 + ε to 100 - σ, where:
    *   ε (epsilon) is a small positive constant representing the minimum deviation from pure inaction (50). *For the purposes of this patent, ε is defined as 0.0000000001 (10<sup>-10</sup>).*
    *   σ (sigma) is a small positive constant representing the maximum deviation from absolute control or unity (100). *For the purposes of this patent, σ is defined as 0.0000000001 (10<sup>-10</sup>).*
3.  **Ethical Evaluation:**
    *   Using a combination of pre-defined rules, heuristics, and, when necessary, simplified models of potential consequences, assess how well the results of `action(n)` aligns with ethical principles of promoting:
        *   Further differentiation
        *   Enhanced interconnectedness
        *   System Stability.
4.  **Scoring:**
    *   The *raw* output of the ethical evaluation will be a percentage value representing the degree of alignment with the ethical principles.
    *   This percentage is then *normalized* to a value between 0 and 1 using the following formula:

        `S_e(n) = (RawScore - (50 + ε)) / ((100 - σ) - (50 + ε))`

        This ensures that:

        *   A raw score of 50 + ε maps to an S<sub>e</sub>(n) of 0.
        *   A raw score of 100 - σ maps to an S<sub>e</sub>(n) of 1.
        *   All other values within the ethical range are linearly scaled between 0 and 1.

    *   ***Crucially, no pinion can be created with a raw ethical score (before normalization) outside the range of 50 + ε to 100 - σ.*** This is not just a matter of assigning a low score; it's a *fundamental constraint* on the system's operation. If a computation would result in a pinion outside this range, *that computation is rejected*.

**5.2.4  `k` (Learning Rate):**

*   `k` in `A(n) = A(n-1) + k * (S(n) - A(n-1))` controls the update speed of the alignment score.
*   `k` is a constant value between 0.01 and 0.2.

**5.2.5 `g(A(n))` (Transformation Readiness Function):**

This function determines when a pinion is considered "stable enough."

*   **Threshold Function:**

    ```
    g(A(n)) = 1  if A(n) >= 0.95
    g(A(n)) = 0  if A(n) < 0.95
    ```

**5.3 Addressing Adversarial Exploits:**

Vetraxis resists adversarial recursion manipulation by ensuring:

*   **Time-Sequenced Locking:** Each pinion is assigned a unique, monotonically increasing timestamp upon creation. The system prevents any modification to pinions with earlier timestamps, ensuring irreversibility. The timestamp is part of the pinion's immutable data. This, combined with the DAG structure, prevents any changes to prior computations.
*   **Distributed Verification:** The DAG structure can be distributed across multiple nodes, with a consensus mechanism (e.g., majority voting) used to resolve any conflicts or inconsistencies. This prevents any single point of failure or control from compromising the system's integrity.

## 6. Conclusion

Vetraxis formalizes the first Recursion Stability Tracker that ensures recursion stability, meltdown-free expansion, and cross-domain adaptability. It achieves this through a novel combination of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, a multi-component alignment function (A(n)), and strict adherence to ethical bounds defined by Pinion Theory. By formalizing these principles, Vetraxis provides a foundation for building AI systems, and other recursive systems, that are inherently stable, transparent, and ethically aligned.
