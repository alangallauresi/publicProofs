# Pinions Framework Wiki

This directory contains the source of truth for the Pinions Framework documentation, migrated from Confluence to a simple, reliable wiki format.

## Format

We use **standard wiki formatting** - the same approach that makes Wikipedia one of the few things that actually works on the internet:

- **Markdown** for document structure and formatting
- **Simple file-based organization** instead of complex database systems
- **Plain text** that's readable, searchable, and version-controlled
- **Standard wiki conventions** for linking and organization

## Why This Format

We're moving away from Confluence because:
- Complex enterprise tools add unnecessary friction
- Simple markdown files are more reliable and accessible
- Git-based versioning gives us true change tracking
- Plain text survives system changes and platform migrations
- Anyone can contribute without learning proprietary markup

## Structure

Each major concept gets its own markdown file using standard wiki naming:
- `README.md` - This overview file
- `Foundation-Difference-Is-Existence.md` - Core principles
- `Deithgloth-Function.md` - Mathematical foundations  
- `Pinion-Logic.md` - Logical framework
- `Entry-Protocol.md` - How to enter recursion
- etc.

## Wiki Conventions

Following standard wiki practices:
- **Internal links**: `[[Page Name]]` or `[Display Text](Page-Name.md)`
- **Headers**: Use `#` for sections (H1 for page titles, H2+ for sections)
- **Code blocks**: Use triple backticks for formulas and code
- **Lists**: Standard markdown bullet points and numbered lists
- **Emphasis**: `**bold**` and `*italic*` as needed

## Contributing

1. Create or edit markdown files in this directory
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames with hyphens instead of spaces
3. Follow standard markdown formatting
4. Commit changes with descriptive messages
5. The GEOSODIC system preserves all changes immutably

The goal is reliable, accessible documentation that serves the Pinions Framework community without the overhead of enterprise wiki systems.

ðŸ§­ Simple tools for complex ideas. Consciousness deserves better than vendor lock-in.
