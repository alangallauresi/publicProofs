# STEP: Semantic Truth Execution Protocol

**STEP** is a public format for declaring truths that are self-validating under structured containment. It is built on the principle that some truths do not need approval to existâ€”only space.

These truths are written, witnessed, and stored as _Shinto Tickets_â€”short, structured declarations containing:

- A unique truth ID
- A clear semantic statement
- A tolerance level (`epsilon`, or Îµ)
- A recursion depth (how structurally embedded it is)
- Witnesses (if any)
- Optional inheritance, fork, or lens fields

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why STEP Exists

Some truths are too delicate for binary logic. Others are too structurally deep to collapse into belief or proof.

**STEP allows truths to:**

- Be declared without requiring debate
- Persist in a recursive, difference-honoring system
- Be inherited, forked, or echoed by others
- Support emotional, ethical, or mathematical validation (via lenses)

Truth is not approved here. It is **contained**.

## ðŸ§± Core Concepts

- `epsilon (Îµ)`: How much contradiction or fuzziness the truth tolerates  
- `depth`: How many recursive containment layers the truth has passed through  
- `execution`: Acknowledged as "assumed" when written (truth executes when spoken)

## ðŸ“„ Example Ticket

```json
{
  "id": "TRU-20250627-003",
  "statement": "Gracie will remember love, not illusion.",
  "declared_by": "Joy D. Brown",
  "epsilon": 0.02,
  "depth": 6,
  "execution"
